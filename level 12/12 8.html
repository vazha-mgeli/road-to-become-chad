    <p>The Toyota Prius (/ˈpriːəs/ PREE-əss) (Japanese: トヨタ・プリウス, Hepburn: Toyota Puriusu) is a compact/small family liftback (supermini/subcompact sedan until 2003) produced by Toyota. The Prius has a hybrid drivetrain, combined with an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Initially offered as a four-door sedan, it has been produced only as a five-door liftback since 2003.

        The Prius was developed by Toyota to be the "car for the 21st century";[1][2] it was the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle,[3] first going on sale in Japan in 1997 at all four Toyota Japan dealership chains,[3] and subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000.[4]
        
        In 2011, Toyota expanded the Prius family to include the Prius v, an MPV, and the Prius c, a subcompact hatchback. The production version of the Prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012. The second generation of the plug-in variant, the Prius Prime, was released in the U.S. in November 2016.[5] The Prius family totaled global cumulative sales of 6.1 million units in January 2017, representing 61% of the 10 million hybrids sold worldwide by Toyota since 1997.[6] Toyota sells the Prius in over 90 markets, with Japan and the United States being its largest markets.[7]</p>
