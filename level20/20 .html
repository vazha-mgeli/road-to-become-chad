    <p class="ss">Coraline is a 2009 American gothic stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film[5] written for the
        screen and directed by Henry Selick, based on the 2002 novella of the same name by Neil Gaiman.[6] Produced by
        Laika, as the studio's first feature film,[7] it features the voices of Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, Jennifer
        Saunders, Dawn French, Keith David, John Hodgman, Robert Bailey Jr., and Ian McShane. The film tells the story
        of its eponymous character discovering an idealized alternate universe behind a secret door in her new home,
        unaware that it contains something dark and sinister.

    <p class="ds"> Just as Gaiman was finishing his novella, he met Selick and invited him to make a film adaptation, as
        Gaiman was a fan of Selick's other stop-motion works, The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and James and the
        Giant Peach (1996). When Selick thought that a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", the
        screenplay was expanded. Looking for a design different from that of most animation, Selick discovered the work
        of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. His biggest influences
        were on the color palette, which was muted in the real world and more colorful in the Other World, as in The
        Wizard of Oz. To capture stereoscopy for the 3D release, the animators shot each frame from two slightly apart
        camera positions. Production of the stop-motion animation took place at a warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon.[8]</p>

    <p class="qw">Coraline premiered at the Portland International Film Festival on February 5, 2009,[9] and was
        released theatrically in the United States on February 6 by Focus Features. The film was met with widespread
        acclaim from critics and grossed $185.7 million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing stop-motion film
        of all time, following Chicken Run (2000) and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005).[10] The
        film won Annie Awards for Best Music in an Animated Feature Production, Best Character Design in an Animated
        Feature Production, and Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, and was nominated for an
        Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It has
        developed a cult following in the years since its release and is considered one of the greatest animated films
        of all time.</p>

    <p class="dfr">Plot
        Eleven-year-old Coraline Jones and her parents, Charlie and Mel, move from Pontiac, Michigan, into the Pink
        Palace Apartments, an old Victorian house in Ashland, Oregon. While searching for an old well, she meets a
        mysterious black cat and Wyborn "Wybie" Lovat, the grandson of Coraline's landlady, who gives her a rag doll
        that eerily resembles Coraline. Since her parents are busy with work, Coraline entertains herself by exploring
        the house, discovering a small door with a brick wall behind it in the living room. That night, she finds that
        the brick wall has been replaced by a tunnel, which leads her to an "Other World", where her parents'
        button-eyed doppelgängers lavish her with delicious food and their attention.
    </p>
    <p class="jk">Upon waking in the morning, Coraline finds herself back in the real world. She meets her other
        neighbors: Mr. Bobinsky, an eccentric Russian liquidator-turned-gymnast who owns a mouse circus, and retired
        burlesque performers April Spink and Miriam Forcible. Wybie tells Coraline about how his grandmother's twin
        sister disappeared when they were children.
        Coraline returns to the Other World that night, where she meets a mute Other Wybie. When she returns yet again,
        the cat, who can travel between the worlds, arrives and warns her about the Other World. The Other Mother later
        offers Coraline to stay in the Other World forever, on the condition that buttons are sewn onto her eyes.
        Horrified, Coraline desperately tries to fall asleep, but she is still in the Other World. When Coraline tries
        to escape through the door, the Other Mother transforms into a taller, skeletal form and imprisons her in a dark
        room through a mirror.</p>

    <p class="rt"> There, three ghost children, one of whom Coraline recognizes as the landlady's missing sister, tell
        Coraline that the Other Mother is an evil entity called the "Beldam", who used rag dolls to spy on their unhappy
        lives and lure them into the Other World with treats and games; they allowed her to sew buttons over their eyes,
        and she subsequently locked their souls inside the mirror. After Coraline promises to help the ghost children by
        retrieving their eyes, the Other Wybie sends her home.
    </p>
    <p class="w"> Back in the real world, Wybie asks Coraline for the doll, as it belongs to his grandmother's missing
        sister. She attempts to explain the situation to him, but he disbelieves her and runs out in fear. Coraline
        borrows an adder stone from Spink and Forcible, and after the cat informs her that the Beldam has kidnapped her
        parents, the two set out to rescue them. Knowing that the Beldam has a penchant for games, Coraline proposes a
        deal: if she finds her parents and the eyes of the ghost children, the Beldam will set them all free; if not,
        she will stay and allow the Beldam to sew the buttons on her eyes.</p>

    <p class="s"> The Beldam reveals that each of the missing eyes is hidden within the three "wonders" she designed for
        Coraline. As Coraline finds and collects each eye using the adder stone, she frees the spirits of the ghost
        children and the Other World begins to fade until all three are collected and only the house remains. The
        Beldam, now a spider-like monster, challenges Coraline to find her parents. Realizing they are trapped in a
        nearby snow globe and that the Beldam will not let her go, she throws the cat to distract her before narrowly
        escaping through the door with the ghost children's help, severing the Beldam's hand in the process. Coraline's
        parents return with no recollection of being kidnapped, and she warmly embraces them.
    </p>
    <p class="d"> At night, the ghosts warn Coraline that the Beldam is still after the cursed key. As Coraline heads
        toward the backyard well to dispose of it, the Beldam's severed hand sneaks into the real world and attempts to
        drag her back in. Wybie, having realized Coraline was right, comes to the rescue and destroys the hand, and they
        both throw the key and the hand's remains into the well. The next day, the Jones family hosts a garden party for
        the Pink Palace residents. Wybie accompanies his grandmother to the party, as Coraline begins to tell her about
        her missing sister's fate.

        "Coraline [was] a huge risk. But these days in animation, the safest bet is to take a risk."

        –Henry Selick[11]
    <p>
    <p class="sa"> Director Henry Selick met author Neil Gaiman just as Gaiman was finishing the novel Coraline, which
        was published in 2002, and as Gaiman was a fan of Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), he invited him
        to make a film adaptation. As Selick thought a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", his
        screenplay had some expansions, such as the creation of Wybie, who was not present in the original novel. When
        looking for a design different from that of most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator
        Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. One of Uesugi's biggest influences was on the
        color palette, which was muted in reality and more colorful in the Other World, as in The Wizard of Oz
        (1939).[12] Uesugi said: "at the beginning, it was supposed to be a small project over a few weeks to simply
        create characters; however, I ended up working on the project for over a year, eventually designing sets and
        backgrounds, on top of drawing the basic images for the story to be built upon."[13]</p>

    <p class="sdf"> Coraline was staged in a 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m2) warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon.[11][14] The
        stage was divided into 50 lots,[15] which played host to nearly 150 sets.[11] Among the sets were three
        miniature Victorian mansions, a 42-foot (12.8 m) apple orchard, and a model of Ashland, Oregon, including tiny
        details such as banners for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.[14] The Amazing Garden scene was the most
        complicated set created for the film. The hundreds of handmade flowers were created to grow and move accordingly
        when Coraline entered the garden.[7] More than 28 animators worked at a time on rehearsing or shooting scenes,
        producing 90–100 seconds of finished animation each week.[16] To capture stereoscopy for the 3D release, the
        animators shot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions.[12]</p>

    <p class="ew"> Every object on the screen was made for the film.[12] The crew used three 3D printing systems from
        Objet in the development and production of the film. Thousands of high-quality 3D models, ranging from facial
        expressions to doorknobs, were printed in 3D using the Polyjet matrix systems, which enable the fast
        transformation of CAD (computer-aided design) drawings into high-quality 3D models.[17] The puppets had separate
        parts for the upper and lower parts of the head that could be exchanged for different facial expressions,[12]
        and the characters could exhibit over 208,000 facial expressions.[17] In the "Hidden Worlds: The Films of LAIKA"
        exhibit at Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture, the sign for "Replacing Faces" display said there were 207,336
        possible face combinations for Coraline and 17,633 for her mother. There were 28 identical puppets of Coraline.
        Each one took 3–4 months to make and usually took 10 people to construct each one.[8] Computer artists
        composited separately shot elements together or added their elements, which had to look handcrafted, not
        computer-generated; for instance, the flames were done with traditional animation and painted digitally, and the
        fog was dry ice.[12]</p>

    <p class="cd"> At its peak, the film involved the efforts of 450 people,[11] including 30[14] to 35[11] animators
        and digital designers in the Digital Design Group (DDG), directed by Dan Casey, and more than 250 technicians
        and designers.[14] Principal photography took 18 months. One crew member, Althea Crome, was hired specifically
        to knit miniature sweaters and other clothing for the puppet characters, sometimes using knitting needles as
        thin as human hair.[11] A single garment could take anywhere from six weeks to six months to complete. The
        clothes also simulated wear using paint and a file.[12]

    <p class="dh">Music
        Main article: Coraline (soundtrack)
        The soundtrack for Coraline features songs by Bruno Coulais, with one ("Other Father Song") by They Might Be
        Giants. The Other Father's singing voice is provided by John Linnell, one of the band's singers. The band was
        hired to write an entire soundtrack for the film, but according to John Flansburgh, the production team "wanted
        the music to be more creepy", and only one song was ultimately used.[18] Coulais's score was performed by the
        Budapest Symphony Orchestra and features choral pieces sung by the Children's Choir of Nice in a nonsense
        language.[19] The main soloist, a young girl heard singing in several parts of the film, is coincidentally named
        Coraline.[19] Coraline won Coulais the 2009 Annie Award for best score for an animated feature.

    <p class="ro"> Reception
        Box office
        According to Paul Dergarabedian, a film business analyst with Media by Numbers, for the film to succeed it
        needed a box office comparable to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which had grossed $16 million
        its opening weekend and ended up grossing $125 million worldwide. Before the film's release, Dergarabedian
        thought Laika Studios "should be pleased" was Coraline to make $10 million in its opening weekend,[14] in its US
        opening weekend, the film grossed $16.85 million, ranking third at the box office.[10] It made $15 million
        during its second weekend, bringing its U.S. total up to $35.6 million, $25.5 million of which came from 3D
        presentations.[20]</p>

    <p class="zd">Critical response
        On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 279 reviews,
        with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "With its vivid stop-motion animation
        combined with Neil Gaiman's imaginative story, Coraline is a film that's both visually stunning and wondrously
        entertaining."[26] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100 based
        on reviews from 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[27]
