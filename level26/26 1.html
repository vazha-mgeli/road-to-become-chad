        <p class="da">Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Ga√∫cho (Brazilian
            Portuguese pronunciation: [ ÅonawÀàd íƒ©…≤u …°aÀàu Éu]) or simply Ronaldinho,[note 1] is a Brazilian former
            professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or left winger. Widely regarded as one of the
            greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He is the
            only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa Am√©rica, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa
            Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or.[4] A global icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his dribbling
            abilities, free-kick accuracy, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes, and overhead kicks, as well as his
            ability to score and create goals. During his career he was one of the most valuable footballers in the
            world.[5][6][7][8] He is known by the nickname "O Bruxo" ('The Wizard').[9][10]</p>

        <p class="dg">Ronaldinho made his career debut for Gr√™mio, in 1998. Aged 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in
            France, where he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup, before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with
            Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004‚Äì05 La Liga title.
            The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning
            the 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving
            Ronaldinho his first career double, receiving the 2005 Ballon d'Or, and his second FIFA World Player of the
            Year in the process. After scoring two solo goals in the first 2005‚Äì06 El Cl√°sico, Ronaldinho became the
            second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans
            at the Santiago Bernab√©u. Due to these successes, Ronaldinho is widely credited with changing Barcelona's
            history.[11]</p>



        <p class="we">Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006‚Äì07 season and an injury-plagued
            2007‚Äì08 season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances‚Äîdue to a decrease in dedication and focus
            towards football‚Äîand departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010‚Äì11 Serie A. He returned to
            Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atl√©tico Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa
            Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Quer√©taro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense
            in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was included in the UEFA
            Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for
            the 2005‚Äì06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he was named by Pel√© in the
            FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. In 2009, he was voted World Player of the Decade
            2000s, ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[12]

            In his international career with Brazil, Ronaldinho earned 97 caps, scored 33 goals, and represented them in
            two FIFA World Cups. After debuting with the Sele√ß√£o by winning the 1999 Copa Am√©rica, he was an integral
            player in the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team, positioned alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking
            trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. He captained his team to the 2005 FIFA
            Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final. He also captained the Brazil Olympic
            team to a bronze medal in men's football at the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p class="ff">Early and personal life

            Born in Porto Alegre in 1980, Ronaldinho moved into an affluent suburb at the age of eight.
            Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio
            Grande do Sul, Brazil.[1][13] His mother, Miguelina El√≥i Assis dos Santos,[14] was a salesperson who studied
            to become a nurse.[15] His father, Jo√£o de Assis Moreira, was a shipyard worker and a footballer for the
            local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with the larger Cruzeiro Esporte Clube).[16] After
            Ronaldo's elder brother Roberto signed with Gr√™mio, the family moved to a home in the more affluent Guaruj√°
            section of Porto Alegre, which was a gift from Gr√™mio to convince Roberto to stay at the club. Still,
            Roberto's career was ultimately cut short by injury. When Ronaldo was eight years old, his father hit his
            head and drowned in the swimming pool at their new home.[17] Roberto has acted as Ronaldo's manager, while
            his sister Deisi has worked as his press coordinator.[18][19]</p>

        <p class="t">Ronaldo's football skills began to blossom at the age of eight, and he was first given the nickname
            Ronaldinho‚Äîinho, meaning 'small'‚Äîbecause he was often the youngest and the smallest player in youth club
            matches.[18] He developed an interest in futsal and beach football, which later expanded to organized
            football.[20] Many of his signature moves originate from futsal, especially his ball control.[21] His first
            brush with the media came at the age of 13, when he scored all 23 goals in a 23‚Äì0 victory against a local
            team.[22] Ronaldinho was identified as a rising star at the 1997 U-17 World Championship in Egypt, in which
            he scored two goals on penalty kicks.[23][24]

            Growing up, his idols included the World Cup‚Äìwinning stars Rivelino (from 1970); Diego Maradona (from 1986);
            Rom√°rio (from 1994); and his two future international teammates Ronaldo and Rivaldo (who would, together
            with him, form the attacking trio in Brazil's 2002 World Cup‚Äìwinning team).[25] Ronaldinho is the father of
            a son, Jo√£o, born on 25 February 2005, to Brazilian dancer Jana√≠na Mendes and named after his late
            father.[26] He gained Spanish citizenship in 2007.[27] In March 2018, Ronaldinho joined the Brazilian
            Republican Party, which has links to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.[28] Ronaldinho endorsed
            presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election.[29]</p>

        <p class="j">Club career
            Gr√™mio
            "I've worked with some great players in my time and all at a very interesting period in their careers,
            nineteen to twenty years old. But, with due respect to the others, Ronaldinho was a cut above the rest."

            ‚Äî Gr√™mio coach Celso Roth.[30]
            Ronaldinho's career began with the Gr√™mio youth squad. He made his senior side debut during the 1998 Copa
            Libertadores.[31] 1999 saw the emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 22 goals in 47 matches, and he
            put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande
            do Sul State Championship final.[32] In a match-winning performance, Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional's
            Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga, flicking the ball over his head on one occasion,
            and leaving him flat-footed in a mazy dribble on another.[32] Ronaldinho achieved further success with
            Gr√™mio, winning the inaugural Copa Sul.[32]

            In 2001, Arsenal expressed interest in signing Ronaldinho, but the move collapsed after he could not obtain
            a work permit because he was a non-EU player who had not played enough international matches.[33] He
            considered playing on loan with Scottish Premier League side St Mirren, which never happened due to his
            involvement in a fake passport scandal in Brazil.[34]

        <p class="k">Paris Saint-Germain

            Ronaldinho arrived at the Parc des Princes (pictured) to much fanfare.[35]
            In 2001, Ronaldinho signed a five-year contract with French club Paris Saint-Germain in a ‚Ç¨5 million
            transfer.[36] Upon his arrival in Paris, Ronaldinho was given the number 21 shirt and inserted into a lineup
            that included fellow Brazilian Alo√≠sio, midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha and striker Nicolas Anelka.[37]

            2001‚Äì02 season
            Ronaldinho made his league debut for the club on 4 August 2001, appearing as a substitute in a 1‚Äì1 draw with
            Auxerre.[38] Ronaldinho spent the majority of the first few months of the 2001‚Äì02 season alternated between
            the bench and starter's role. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 October in a 2‚Äì2 draw against
            Lyon, converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute after having come on ten minutes prior.[39] After
            returning from the winter break, Ronaldinho went on a tear, scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to
            open the new campaign. He recorded impressive goals against Monaco, Rennes, Lens and Lorient. On 16 March
            2002, he recorded a double in PSG's 3‚Äì1 victory against relegation strugglers Troyes.[40] He scored his
            final league goal of the season in the club's 2‚Äì0 win over Metz on 27 April.[41]

            Ronaldinho was also influential in the 2001‚Äì02 Coupe de la Ligue, helping PSG reach the semi-finals where
            they were eliminated by Bordeaux. In a Round of 16 match against Guingamp, Ronaldinho scored two second half
            goals in the game after having entered the match as a half-time substitute. Despite Ronaldinho's initial
            success with the club, the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Fern√°ndez,
            claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian nightlife rather than football, and complained
            that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times.[31]</p>
