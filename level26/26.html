            <h1 class="d">son heung-min üòØüòØ</h1>
            <p class="cv">Son Heung-min (Korean: ÏÜêÌù•ÎØº; Korean pronunciation: [son.…£…Ø≈ã.min]; born 8 July 1992)[note 2] is
                a
                South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Premier League club
                Tottenham Hotspur and the South Korea national team.[3] Widely recognized as one of the most highly
                skilled
                players of his generation, he is highly praised for his speed, finishing, two-footedness, and ability to
                link play.[6][7]

                Born in Chuncheon, South Korea, Son relocated to Germany to join Hamburger SV at 16, making his debut in
                the
                Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record ‚Ç¨10 million before signing
                for
                Tottenham for ¬£22 million two years later, becoming the most expensive Asian player in history.[8] While
                at
                Tottenham, Son became the top Asian goalscorer in both Premier League and Champions League history,[9]
                and
                surpassed Cha Bum-kun's record for most goals scored by a Korean player in European
                competition.[10][11][12]
                In 2019, he became the second Asian in history to reach and start a UEFA Champions League final after
                compatriot Park Ji-sung.[13] In the 2021‚Äì22 season, alongside Mohamed Salah, he won the Premier League
                Golden Boot award with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to win it.[14] In April 2023, he became
                the
                first Asian player to score 100 Premier League goals. He is also the club's fifth-highest goalscorer and
                all-time leader in assists. Son is the third Tottenham player to make 300 Premier League appearances for
                the
                club, after Hugo Lloris and Harry Kane.[15]</p>

            <p class="dc">A full international since 2010, Son has represented South Korea at the 2014, 2018, and 2022
                FIFA
                World Cups and is his country's joint top scorer at World Cups, tied with Park Ji-sung and Ahn Jung-hwan
                on
                three goals. Son has also represented South Korea at the 2018 Asian Games, where the team won gold, and
                the
                2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023 editions of the AFC Asian Cup; Korea was the runner-up in 2015.

                Outside of football, Son is viewed as a symbol of national pride in South Korea for his achievements,
                and
                has been listed in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 since 2019, where he ranked second in
                2023.[16][17][18]
                In June 2022, Son received the Cheongnyong Medal, the highest order of merit for achievement in sports
                given
                to a South Korean citizen, for his achievements in football.[19] Son has been credited for having raised
                the
                profile of Tottenham Hotspur among South Koreans, with the club's marketing and social media strategy
                catering extensively to Korean supporters.[20]</p>

            <p class="as">Early life
                Son Heung-min was born in Chuncheon, Gangwon.[21] He is of the Miryang Son clan [ko].[22] His father,
                Son
                Woong-jung, is a retired footballer turned manager who once played for the South Korea national B
                team.[23]

                Son came through the academy at FC Seoul, the same club that former Spurs defender Lee Young-pyo played
                for.[24] Son was a ball boy in an FC Seoul home match in 2008 when he was a FC Seoul youth player.[25]
                At
                that time, his role model was midfielder Lee Chung-yong, who played for Crystal Palace and Bolton
                Wanderers.[26][27] Apart from his native language Korean, Son is also fluent in German and English. His
                agent Thies Bliemeister said Son was so determined to make himself a success in Europe that he learned
                German by watching episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants.[28]

                Club career
                Hamburger SV
                In August 2008, Son dropped out of Dongbuk High School's football club (formerly FC Seoul under-18
                team)[29]
                and joined Hamburger SV's youth academy at age 16 through Korean FA Youth Project [ko].[30][31] A year
                later, he returned to South Korea. After participating in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, he formally joined
                Hamburger SV's youth academy in November 2009[32]


                Son warming up for Hamburger SV in 2011
                He was impressive in the 2010‚Äì11 pre-season, leading the team with nine goals, and signed his first
                professional contract on his 18th birthday.[33] After scoring against Chelsea in August, he was out for
                two
                months due to a foot injury. He returned on 30 October 2010 to score his first league goal, against 1.
                FC
                K√∂ln in the 24th minute. The goal made Son the youngest Hamburg player to score a goal in the Bundesliga
                at
                18, breaking the record held by Manfred Kaltz.[34][35]</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">

            <p class="v">Son signed a new deal with Hamburg through 2014. Pundits said he had what it took to become the
                next Cha Bum-kun, a legendary Bundesliga forward and fellow South Korean.[36] Son scored three goals in
                14
                matches in all competition during the 2010‚Äì11 season.[37]


                Son (left) playing for Hamburger SV against Elia of Werder Bremen in August 2012
                During the 2011‚Äì12 pre-season, Son was explosive, scoring 18 times in only nine matches.[38][39][40]
                After
                missing the opening match due to a fever, Son scored two goals within three matches.[41] On 27 August,
                Son
                picked up an ankle injury in the 4‚Äì3 loss to 1. FC K√∂ln and was initially projected to be out of action
                for
                four to six weeks.[42] His recovery was quicker than expected and he returned to action only three weeks
                later as a substitute in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach on 17 September. Over the course of
                the
                2011‚Äì12 season, he made 30 appearances for Hamburg and scored five goals,[43] including crucial goals
                against Hannover 96 and 1. FC N√ºrnberg at the end of the season to help ensure that Hamburg remained in
                the
                Bundesliga.[44]

                Following Hamburger SV's 2012‚Äì13 offseason moves, which saw the transfers of the team's strikers Mladen
                Petriƒá and Paolo Guerrero to Fulham and Corinthians respectively, manager Thorsten Fink chose to name
                Son a
                starter. The 2012‚Äì13 season was a breakthrough season for Son as he scored two goals in an away fixture
                against Borussia Dortmund on 9 February 2013, helping his team to a 4‚Äì1 victory. Son was chosen Mann des
                Tages (Man of the Match) by kicker.[45] On 14 April, Son netted two goals in a 2‚Äì1 win against Mainz 05.
                He
                finished the season with 12 goals, becoming the fifth South Korean footballer to achieve double digits
                in
                goals in Europe.[46] He finished the 2012‚Äì13 season with 12 goals in 34 matches in all competitions.[47]
            </p>

            <p class="g">On 13 June 2013, Bayer Leverkusen confirmed Son's transfer for reportedly ‚Ç¨10 million, which
                was
                the highest transfer fee in the club's history at the time. He agreed to a five-year deal with the
                team.[48]
                Son adjusted quickly to his new club in the pre-season, scoring three goals in his first three
                appearances
                for the team in exhibition matches (against 1860 Munich, Udinese and KAS Eupen respectively).[49]

                On 9 November 2013, Son scored a hat-trick for Leverkusen in a 5‚Äì3 win against his former club
                Hamburgers
                SV.[50] On 7 December, Son scored a crucial goal against Borussia Dortmund to put his club just four
                points
                off the summit of the Bundesliga. On 10 May 2014, Son scored another goal against Werder Bremen ensuring
                his
                team a spot for the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Champions League.[51] He finished the 2013‚Äì14 season with 12 goals in
                43
                matches.[52]

                Son scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg on 14 February 2015, in a 4‚Äì5 defeat, scoring when they
                were
                losing 0‚Äì3.[53] He finished the 2014‚Äì15 season with 17 goals in 42 matches.[54]

                Son started the 2015‚Äì16 season with Bayer Leverkusen. He made a league appearance[55] and a Champions
                League
                qualifying match.[56]</p>


            <p class="ds">Tottenham Hotspur
                2015‚Äì16: Debut season
                On 28 August 2015, Son joined Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£22 million (‚Ç¨30 million) on a
                five-year contract, subject to work permit and international clearance.[57][58] Upon his signing, he
                became
                the most expensive Asian player in football history.[8] The record had been held since 2001 by Japanese
                Hidetoshi Nakata, who transferred from Roma to Parma for ‚Ç¨25 million.[59]

                Son made his debut on 13 September away to Sunderland, being replaced by Andros Townsend in the 62nd
                minute
                of a 1‚Äì0 win.[60] In Tottenham's first match of the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League on 17 September, Son
                netted
                his first two goals for the club in a 3‚Äì1 win against Qarabaƒü FK.[61] Three days later, he scored his
                first
                Premier League goal, against Crystal Palace at White Hart Lane, netting in the 68th minute to give
                Tottenham
                their first home Premier League win of the season.[62] On 28 December in the match against Watford, Son
                replaced Tom Carroll in the 80th minute and scored Tottenham's winning goal in the 89th minute.[63] On 2
                May, he scored the second goal against Chelsea in a crucial match to give Spurs hope of winning the
                Premier
                League. Chelsea equalised in the second half, however, handing over the title to Leicester City.[64]</p>

        <p class="h">2016‚Äì2018: Breakthrough and Premier League runner-up

            Son playing for Tottenham Hotspur in 2016
            Before the season, he reportedly asked Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino for permission to leave
            Tottenham
            in an attempt to get more playing time, but was instead given a chance to fight for his place at
            Spurs.[65]
            On 10 September 2016, Son scored two goals and created a third in his first appearance of the season, in
            a
            4‚Äì0 win against Stoke City.[66] Son followed that performance up with a second brace, coming at
            Middlesbrough on 24 September, earning his team a 1‚Äì2 victory.[67] Upon equalling his league goal total
            from
            the previous season in 25 fewer matches, Son was hailed by Pochettino as "a different person ‚Äì he's more
            mature and he knows the league and he's settled in fantastically now."[68] Son continued his excellent
            run
            of form with his fifth goal in five matches on 27 September in the Champions League. Playing at CSKA
            Moscow,
            Son slipped a shot past goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev for the only goal of the match.[69] On 14 October, Son
            was
            named the Premier League Player of the Month for September, being the first South Korean and first Asian
            to
            receive the award.[70]</p>

        <p class="vv">Following the Christmas break Son continued to score the odd goal over the following couple of
            months and then on 12 March 2017 he scored his first Spurs hat trick in the FA Cup against Millwall in a
            6‚Äì0
            win.[71] In the same match, he was racially abused by a section of the Millwall fans who chanted "DVD"
            and
            "he's selling three for a fiver" whenever he touched the ball, referencing a stereotype towards east
            Asians.[72] He scored in the 2‚Äì0 victory away at Burnley on 1 April 2017,[73] and four days later he
            scored
            in the 91st minute to put Spurs ahead at Swansea, in a game where they were losing 1‚Äì0 after 88 minutes
            and
            ended up winning 3‚Äì1.[74] A brace at home to Watford the following weekend brought his season total to
            18
            goals, 11 in the Premier League, his best ever goals return.[75] On 12 May 2017, Tottenham announced
            that
            Son had won the Premier League Player of the Month for April, the second time of his career and thus
            becoming the only player in 2016‚Äì17 to win the award 2 times.[76] On 18 May 2017, Son bagged a brace
            away to
            Leicester City as part of a 6‚Äì1 rout of their former title rivals. With 21 goals in all competitions,
            Son
            joined Harry Kane and Dele Alli as the first trio of Spurs players with over 20 goals on the season.[77]
        </p>

        <div class="container">
            <p class="gh">Son scored his first goal of the 2017‚Äì18 season in the UEFA Champions League game against
                Borussia
                Dortmund on 13 September 2017 at Spurs temporary home Wembley Stadium, which Spurs won 3‚Äì1.[78][79] He
                scored his first Premier League goal in the season when Spurs beat Liverpool 4‚Äì1 at home.[80] On 5
                November
                2017, Son scored the only goal in the 1‚Äì0 win against Crystal Palace. The goal brought his tally in the
                Premier League to 20 and in doing so he became the top Asian goalscorer in Premier League history,
                breaking
                the record set by Park Ji-Sung at Manchester United.[12] On 13 January 2018, Son scored a goal and
                provided
                an assist in a game against Everton, matching the club record set in 2004 by Jermain Defoe of scoring in
                five consecutive home games.[81] On 28 February 2018, Son scored a brace and assisted Fernando Llorente
                as
                Tottenham beat Rochdale 6‚Äì1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Son also converted a penalty, but his goal
                was
                overruled by the video assistant referee.[82] Son has become the first Asian to finish the season as a
                top-10 goal scorer in the English Premier League.[83]


                2018‚Äì19: Champions League runner-up
                On 20 July 2018, Son signed a new five-year deal extending his contract with Tottenham until 2023.[84]
                The
                first goals of the season came in October 2018 when he scored a brace in his 150th game for Tottenham in
                the
                2018‚Äì19 EFL Cup match against West Ham.[85] He scored his first league goal in the season, his 50th goal
                for
                the club in all competitions, in a solo effort in the 3‚Äì1 home win against Chelsea, inflicting the first
                defeat for Chelsea in the Premier League this season.[86][87] This goal won the Premier League's Goal of
                the
                Month award for November.[88] On 13 February 2019, Son scored the first goal in a 3‚Äì0 win over Borussia
                Dortmund, in the first leg of the round of 16, UEFA Champions League.[89] At the end of the month he was
                named Premier League Player of the Year at the London Football Awards.[90] On 3 April 2019, Son scored
                the
                first professional goal at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Crystal Palace.[91]
