    <p class="lloris">Hugo Hadrien Dominique Lloris (born 26 December 1986) is a French professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC.

        Lloris began his career with hometown club Nice, made his debut as a teenager in October 2005, and started as a goalkeeper during the team's run to the 2006 Coupe de la Ligue final. After excelling at the club for three seasons, he moved to seven-time Ligue 1 champions Lyon, amid interest from several other clubs, notably AC Milan. Lloris won several domestic awards in his first season with Lyon and, in his second campaign, earned award nominations for his performances in the UEFA Champions League, which saw Lyon reach the semi-finals for the first time. He was also named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year on three occasions during his time at the club.
        
        Lloris joined Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in 2012 and made over 400 appearances for the club across eleven seasons, being named captain in 2015 and helping the team reach the UEFA Champions League final in 2019. He departed England in 2024 to join Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer.
        
        Lloris is a former French international, having represented his nation at under-18, under-19, and under-21 level. Prior to playing at senior level, he played on the team that won the 2005 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. Lloris made his senior international debut in November 2008 in a friendly against Uruguay. He helped France qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was applauded by the media for his performance over two legs against the Republic of Ireland in the qualifying play-offs. He captained the national team for the first time in 2010, and became first-choice captain on 28 February 2012, leading France into the quarter-finals of both UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup, as runners-up at Euro 2016 and the 2022 World Cup, and winning the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. With 145 appearances, he is France's most-capped player.
