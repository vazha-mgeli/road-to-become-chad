    <h1 class="zdzd">desert camel</h1>
    <p class="ded">A camel (from Latin: camelus and ‹See Tfd›Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Ancient Semitic: gāmāl[7][8])
        is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its
        back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (camel milk and meat) and textiles
        (fiber and felt from camel hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a
        vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped
        dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The wild
        Bactrian camel is a distinct species that is not ancestral to the domestic Bactrian camel, and is now critically
        endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals.

        The word camel is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is "camelid", to include
        all seven species of the family Camelidae: the true camels (the above three species), along with the "New World"
        camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña, which belong to the separate tribe Lamini.[9]
        Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene, with the ancestor of modern camels, Paracamelus,
        migrating across the Bering land bridge into Asia during the late Miocene, around 6 million years ago.</p>
