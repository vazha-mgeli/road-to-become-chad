        Jude Victor William Bellingham (born 29 June 2003) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the England national team. Known for his pace, dribbling, passing, and finishing, he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.[7]

        Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8, became the club's youngest first-team player when he made his senior debut in August 2019, at the age of 16 years, 38 days, and played regularly during the 2019–20 season. He joined Borussia Dortmund in July 2020, and in his first appearance became their youngest goalscorer. Over three seasons with the club he made 132 appearances and won the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal; his performances in the 2022–23 season helped Dortmund finish as runners-up and earned him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award. Later that year he won both major awards for male footballers aged under 21: the Golden Boy, for nominees playing in Europe over the last calendar year,[8] and the Kopa Trophy, for the world's best over the previous season.[9][10] Bellingham then signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €103 million, and in his first season, was the club's top league scorer, helped them win the league title and the Champions League, and was voted La Liga Player of the Season.[11]
        
        Bellingham represented England at under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-21 levels. He made his first appearance for the senior team in November 2020, and represented the country at UEFA Euro 2020 and 2024 as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
