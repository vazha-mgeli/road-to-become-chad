        <p class="f">Nicolas Jackson (born 20 June 2001) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier
            League club Chelsea and for the Senegal national team.

            He played for Casa Sports in Senegal before joining Villarreal in 2019. After a loan to MirandÃ©s in the
            Segunda DivisiÃ³n, he broke through in the reserve team and made his first-team debut in La Liga in 2021. In
            2023, he signed an eight-year deal at Chelsea for a reported fee of Â£32 million.



            Jackson made his senior international debut for Senegal in 2022. He was chosen for the 2022 FIFA World Cup
            and the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.


        </p>

        <p class="er">Early career
            Jackson began playing for local side ASC Tilene before joining Casa Sports,[8] where he was a part of the
            first team squad during the 2018â€“19 season.[9][10] He was also named man of the match in a 1â€“1 Ligue 1 draw
            against AS Pikine on 16 November 2018.[11][12]

            Villarreal
            In September 2019, Jackson agreed to a contract with La Liga side Villarreal,[13][14] being assigned to the
            Juvenil A squad.

            Loan to MirandÃ©s
            On 5 October 2020, Jackson was loaned to Segunda DivisiÃ³n side MirandÃ©s for the 2020â€“21 season.[15] He made
            his professional debut thirteen days later, coming on as a second-half substitute for Antonio Caballero in a
            0â€“0 home draw against Mallorca.[16]

            Jackson scored his first professional goal on 28 November 2020, netting the opener in a 1â€“1 home draw
            against CD CastellÃ³n.[17] It was his only goal of the season as the Jabatos finished in 10th place.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container">
        <p class="FIFA">Chelsea
            On 30 June 2023, Jackson signed for Premier League club Chelsea on an eight-year deal through 2031 for a fee
            reported to be Â£32 million.[21] On 13 August, he made his debut for the club in a 1â€“1 draw against Liverpool
            in the Premier League.[22] Jackson scored his first Chelsea goal on 25 August 2023 against newly promoted
            side Luton Town, helping Chelsea to a 3â€“0 win at Stamford Bridge.[23] He scored his second Chelsea goal in a
            1â€“0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion in the EFL Cup.[24] On 6 November, Jackson scored twice in second-half
            stoppage time to complete a hat-trick in a 4â€“1 away win over Tottenham Hotspur.[25] He scored again in the
            next match against Manchester City, which ended in a 4â€“4 home draw.[26]

            On 15 April 2024, Jackson scored his tenth Premier League goal of the season as well as providing an assist
            for Cole Palmer in a 6â€“0 win over Everton. As Palmer had already reached double digits in league goals, this
            became the first Chelsea season since 2017â€“18 in which two players had scored ten or more Premier League
            goals in a season.[27] On 5 May 2024, Jackson scored his first brace for Chelsea as well as providing an
            assist for Cole Palmer in a 5-0 home win over West Ham.[28]</p>

        <p class="xx">Despite the heavy criticisms he faced in his first season in Chelsea, Jackson managed to score 14
            Premier League goals in 35 appearances to make him the second highest African goal scorer in the 2023â€“24
            season only behind Mohamed Salah.[29]

            On 13 September 2024, Jackson signed a two-year contract extension with Chelsea, extending his contract
            until 2033.[30]

            Jackson entered the 2024-2025 season strongly, with a goal and an assist to Cole Palmer against Wolves on 25
            August 2024, following by another goal against Crystal Palace the following week. He would later go on to
            net a brace and assist another for Cole Palmer against West Ham. After the October international break,
            Jackson scored in back-to-back games against Liverpool and Newcastle, respectively.</p>

        <div class="container">

        <p class="dd">International career
            Jackson represented Senegal at under-20 level,[31][32] receiving his first call-up in November 2018.[33]

            After being called up to the full side by manager Aliou CissÃ© for two friendlies in September 2022, Jackson
            was included in the 26-man list for the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 11 November 2022.[34] He made his full
            international debut in Senegal's opening match of the competition, replacing KrÃ©pin Diatta in a 2â€“0 loss
            against the Netherlands.[35]

            In December 2023, Jackson was named in Senegal's squad for the postponed 2023 Africa Cup of Nations held in
            the Ivory Coast.[36] He came on as a substitute in all four games as the defending champions made it to the
            last 16.[37]

            On 11 October 2024, Jackson scored his first international goal, concluding a 4â€“0 home win over Malawi in
            2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.[38]</p>
