        <p class="xs">Vinícius José Paixão de Oliveira Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese: [viˈnisjuz ʒoˈzɛ pajˈʃɐ̃w̃ dʒi
            oliˈvejɾɐ ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 12 July 2000), commonly known as Vinícius Júnior or Vini Jr., is a Brazilian
            professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Real Madrid and the Brazil national team.
            Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his pace and dribbling ability.[3]

            Born in São Gonçalo, Vinícius began his professional career at Flamengo, where he made his senior debut in
            2017,
            at age 16. A few weeks later, Vinícius was the subject of a transfer to La Liga club Real Madrid, for whom
            he
            signed in a £38 million deal, which was a national record for an U-18 player.[4] The transfer was made
            effective
            after his 18th birthday, with Vinícius debuting for the club in 2018–19. Over the following seasons,
            Vinícius
            established himself as a prominent member in Real Madrid's squad, helping the club win two La Liga–Champions
            League doubles, scoring the winning goal in the 2022 and 2024 finals, being named the tournament's Player of
            the
            Season in 2024.[5][6][7]</p>


        <p class="week">Between 2007 and 2010, Vinícius attended futsal classes at Flamengo's school in São Gonçalo at
            the
            Canto do Rio, a famous club located in the centre of Niterói. Flamengo noted his potential and he decided he
            wanted to play football, not futsal. In August 2010, Vinícius had a trial to play for the Flamengo youth
            team,
            and he accepted an invitation to play for their football team.[10] Before, in 2009, when Vinícius was nine,
            he
            took a futsal trial for Flamengo, he was asked to come back the following year.[citation needed]

            Flamengo

            Vinícius playing for Flamengo in 2018
            Vinícius debuted for Flamengo on 13 May 2017 as an 82nd-minute substitute in a Brazilian Série A 1–1 draw
            against Atlético Mineiro.[11][12] Two days later he extended his contract with the club from 2019 until
            2022,
            with a significant salary increase and a buyout clause increase from €30 million to €45 million.[13] This
            contract renewal was reported as being part of the transfer process of Vinícius to Real Madrid, an agreement
            reached between the two clubs in Gávea that week with an obligation to sell the young player in July
            2018.[14]

            On 10 August 2017, Vinícius scored the first professional goal of his career in a Copa Sudamericana second
            round
            leg 2 match against Palestino in a 5–0 win for Flamengo. He scored one goal, 30 seconds after being
            substituted
            on in the 72nd minute. On 19 August, he scored his first Brazilian Série A goals for Flamengo, in a 2–0 win
            against Atlético Goianiense.</p>

        <p class="history">Real Madrid
            On 23 May 2017, La Liga club Real Madrid signed a contract to acquire Vinícius, effective after his 18th
            birthday on 12 July 2018 (as age 18 is the minimum age for international transfer).[20] He transferred for a
            reported fee of €46 million, which was at the time, the second most expensive sale of a player in the
            history of
            Brazilian football (behind only Neymar), the largest amount received by a Brazilian club for a transfer, and
            the
            highest amount ever paid by a club for a footballer under the age of 19.[21][22] He was originally scheduled
            to
            return to Brazil on loan in July 2018.[20]

            2018–21: Development and adaptation to Spain
            On 20 July 2018, he was officially presented as a Real Madrid player.[23] He was issued squad number 28.[24]
            He
            made his debut on 29 September, coming in as an 87th-minute substitute in a goalless draw against Atlético
            Madrid.[25] Vinícius made his first start on 31 October in a 4–0 Copa del Rey away victory against
            Melilla,[26]
            contributing with assists for both Marco Asensio and Álvaro Odriozola in what Marca recognised as a Man of
            the
            Match performance.[24] He scored his first goal on 3 November 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute in
            a
            2–0 victory against Real Valladolid.[27] He scored four goals between his debut on 29 September and 7
            February
            2019.[28] On 6 March, he tore a ligament during a loss to Ajax, which ended his season.[29]

            On 11 December 2019, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 3–1 away win over Club Brugge in
            the
            2019–20 season.[30] On 1 March 2020, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 win for Real in El Clásico against
            Barcelona.[31] He made 29 appearances during the league season, while scoring three goals, as Real Madrid
            won
            the 2019–20 La Liga.[32]</p>

        <p class="ef"> On 6 April 2021, Vinícius scored two goals in a 3–1 win against Liverpool in the first leg of the
            2020–21 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals.[33] Real Madrid would advance to the semi-finals where they
            lost
            to eventual champions Chelsea.[34]

            2021–22: Breakthrough, second league title, and UEFA Champions League victory

            Vinícius Jr. in a trophy presentation ceremony at Virgin of Almudena in 2022
            Vinícius started the 2021–22 season by scoring Real Madrid's fourth goal in a 4–1 away victory over Alavés
            on
            the opening day of the La Liga campaign.[35] On 22 August, he scored a brace in a 3–3 draw against Levante
            coming off the bench, which earned him a first-team place, ahead of Eden Hazard.[36] On 30 October, he
            scored
            twice as Real Madrid won 2–1 at Elche to go top of the La Liga table.[37] The goals were his sixth and
            seventh
            of the league season and his eighth and ninth overall, surpassing his total output of six goals in all
            competitions during the 2020–21 season in just 14 matches.[37] On 12 May 2022, he scored his first hat-trick
            for
            Real Madrid in a 6–0 victory over Levante.[38]

            On 28 May, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the Champions League final to clinch
            Madrid
            their record 14th UEFA Champions League title.[39] Vinícius ended the 2021–22 season as Real Madrid's
            second-best goalscorer with 22 goals in all competitions, only behind his attacking partner Karim
            Benzema.[40]
            For his performances Vinícius was named the inaugural Champions League young player of the season[41] and
            included in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League team of the season.[42]</p>

        <p class="df">2022–23: Inheritance of the No. 7 shirt and Club World Cup title
            On 11 February, Real Madrid defeated Al-Hilal 5–3 in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup final as Vinícius scored a
            brace to claim the tournament's best player award and his second Club World Cup title.[43] On 21 February
            2023,
            Vinícius scored two first-half goals to power Real Madrid's 5–2 comeback win at Anfield against Liverpool in
            the
            first leg of their Champions League knockout stage round of 16 tie.[44][45]

            On 9 May 2023, Vinícius made a significant contribution to Real Madrid's performance in the first leg of the
            semi-final against Manchester City, scoring a remarkable long-range goal in the 36th minute.[46] Alongside
            teammates Rodrygo and Karim Benzema, he created numerous opportunities, showcasing Real Madrid's
            counter-attacking prowess against Manchester City's dominant possession.[47] The match ultimately ended in a
            1–1
            draw.[48] However, in the second leg of the semi-final, Real Madrid suffered a crushing 4–0 defeat against
            City,
            thereby ending their campaign for the Champions League title.[49][50] He was selected in the 2022–23 UEFA
            Champions League team of the tournament.[51]

            In the aftermath of Hazard's departure, Real Madrid confirmed that Vinícius, who previously wore the No. 20
            shirt, would be sporting the club's iconic No. 7 jersey, once worn by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl, from
            2023–24
            season onwards.[52][53]

            2023–24: Third La Liga title, Second Champions League trophy, UCL player of the season, and becoming club
            talisman
            On 19 August 2023, Vinícius scored the decisive goal in a La Liga match against Almería, contributing to
            Real
            Madrid's victory alongside teammate Jude Bellingham, who netted the previous two goals.[54] On 25 August
            2023,
            Vinícius sustained an injury to his right biceps femoris muscle during a league match against Celta, a game
            that
            Real Madrid ultimately won 1–0.[55][56] On 27 September 2023, Vinícius made his return to play in a league
            fixture against Las Palmas after recovering from his injury.[57] On 3 October, he got his first Champions
            League
            goal of the season, netting the 1–1 equaliser in Madrid's away game against Napoli, which eventually ended
            in a
            3–2 win.[58]</p>

        <p class="rfg">Real Madrid announced on 31 October 2023 that they had extended Vinícius' contract until 30 June
            2027.[59][60] On 14 January 2024, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 victory over Barcelona in the Supercopa de
            España final.[61] Throughout the month of March, Vinícius went on a rich goalscoring run, scoring six goals
            in
            four matches across all competitions, including a brace against Valencia at Mestalla Stadium, and the tie
            winning goal against RB Leipzig in the Champions League last 16 to help Real Madrid advance to the
            quarter-finals.[62] On 21 April, he scored another goal against Barcelona in Real Madrid's 3–2 home win to
            help
            Los Blancos virtually seal the league title. On 30 April, he netted a brace in a 2–2 away draw against
            Bayern
            Munich in the Champions League semi-final first leg; hence, he managed to score at that round for the third
            consecutive season, in addition to reaching at least 20 goals in all competitions for the third straight
            season.[63] He then followed up this performance with another man of the match performance against Bayern in
            the
            second leg, helping Real Madrid win 2–1 and advance to the final.

            On 1 June, Vinícius scored in Real Madrid's 2–0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the 2024 UEFA Champions League
            Final, winning his second trophy in the competition.[64] Aged 23 years and 325 days, he became the youngest
            player to score in two Champions League finals, beating Lionel Messi's record by thirteen days.[65] Two days
            later, Vinícius was named the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season, registering six goals and five
            assists
            in Madrid's trophy-winning campaign.[66]</p>


        <p class="we">2015–2019: Success at youth level
            On 30 October 2015, Vinícius was called up for Brazil by coach Guilherme Dalla Déa for the South American
            U-15
            Championship. Vinícius and Brazil won the U-15 title and he was the 2nd top-scorer of the tournament with
            seven
            goals. He was named player of the tournament and continued to perform which helped him convince Flamengo to
            sign
            him by the age of 16.[69] On 24 June 2016, Vinícius was called up for a friendly against Chile U-17 and
            scored
            two goals and provided two assists in the 4–2 victory.

            In March 2017, Vinícius debuted in the South American U-17 Championship for Brazil with a goal in a 3–0
            victory
            over Peru.[70] In the final stage, he scored two goals in a 3–0 win over Ecuador and two goals in a 3–0
            victory
            over Colombia, securing Brazil's place in the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup in India, where Brazil (without
            Vinícius)
            eventually would finish third.[71][72][73] After leading Brazil to win the South American U-17 Championship,
            he
            was named the tournament's best player and was top goal-scorer with seven goals.[74]

            2019–2022: Senior and World Cup debuts

            Vinicius with Brazil in 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Serbia
            On 28 February 2019, Vinícius was called up to the Brazil national team for the first time for friendlies
            against Panama and the Czech Republic.[75] However, he suffered an injury while playing for Real Madrid, and
            David Neres was called up in his place in March.[76] In May, he was excluded from Brazil's final 23-man
            squad
            for the 2019 Copa América by manager Tite.[77] He made his senior international debut on 10 September, as a
            72nd-minute substitute in Brazil's 1–0 defeat to Peru.[78]

            Vinícius was named in Brazil's 2021 Copa América squad by Tite on 9 June 2021, which was held on home
            soil.[79]
            He made a substitute appearance in his nation's 1–0 defeat to rivals Argentina in the final on 10 July.[80]

            On 24 March 2022, Vinícius scored his debut goal for the national team, in a 4–0 home win over Chile in a
            2022
            FIFA World Cup qualification match at the Maracanã Stadium.[81]

            On 7 November 2022, Vinícius was named in the Brazil squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by Tite.[82] In the
            opening group match against Serbia on 24 November, he set-up Richarlison's second goal to help Brazil to a
            2–0
            victory.[83] He scored his first FIFA World Cup goal in a 4–1 win against South Korea in the round of 16 on
            5
            December, also setting up Lucas Paquetá's goal, helping Brazil qualify for the quarter-finals,[84] where
            they
            were eliminated by Croatia four days later following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out loss after a 1–1 draw.[85]

            On 26 March 2024, Vinícius captained the national team for the first time in a friendly against Spain at the
            Santiago Bernabéu, his club's home ground.[86]

            At the 2024 Copa América, Vinícius scored his first two goals in the tournament in Brazil's second group
            match,
            a 4–1 win against Paraguay,[87] also picking up a yellow card; he picked up another booking in his nation's
            final group match, a 1–1 draw against Colombia, which ruled him out of the quarter-finals. In his absence,
            Brazil were eliminated following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out defeat after a goalless draw against
            Uruguay.[88][89]
