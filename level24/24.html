        <p class="wq">Otar Kakabadze (Order of Honor) (Georgian: ოთარ კაკაბაძე, romanized: otar k'ak'abadze, pronounced
            [otʰaɾ kʼakʼabadze]; born 27 June 1995) is a Georgian professional footballer who plays as a right-back for
            Polish club Cracovia, which he captains, and the Georgia national team.

            Club career
            Dinamo Tbilisi
            Born in Tbilisi, Kakabadze was a Dinamo Tbilisi youth graduate. He made his debut with the reserves on 27
            November 2012, starting in a 2–0 away win against Racha Ambrolauri, and scored his first senior goal in a
            6–0 home routing of Kakheti Telavi on 19 October 2013.

            Kakabadze was promoted to the main squad in 2014. He made his professional debut on 16 September of that
            year, coming on as a second-half substitute for Irakli Dzaria in a 6–0 home thrashing of Shukura
            Kobuleti.[1]

            Kakabadze quickly established himself as a starter at Dinamo, and scored his first professional goal on 23
            October 2015, netting the winner in a 2–1 home success over FC Tskhinvali.</p>

        <p class="vf">Gimnàstic
            On 7 July 2016, Kakabadze signed a three-year deal with Spanish Segunda División side Gimnàstic de
            Tarragona.[2]

            On 4 January 2017, it was confirmed, that Kakabadze had signed a loan-deal with Danish Superliga club
            Esbjerg fB for the rest of the season.[3] Upon returning, he became a regular starter for Nàstic.

            FC Luzern
            On 30 August 2018, Kakabadze was transferred to Swiss side FC Luzern.[4]

            Tenerife
            On 25 September 2020, Kakabadze returned to Spain and its second division after agreeing to a contract with
            CD Tenerife.[5]

            Cracovia
            On 12 June 2021, Ekstraklasa club Cracovia announced signing Kakabadze on a three-year deal.[6]

            During this period Kakabadze took part in 69 league matches, scoring six times. During the 2022–23 season,
            he was included in the Ekstraklasa Team of the Week four times.[7]

            In May 2024, his contract with the club was extended until 2027.[8]

            International career
            After representing Georgia at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels, Kakabadze made his debut for the full
            squad on 8 October 2015, starting in a 4–0 home win against Gibraltar for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers.[9]

            In late March 2024, Kakabadze played both UEFA Euro 2024 play-off matches in full and contributed to the
            senior team's historic achievement.[10] In May 2024, he was selected in Georgia's squad for the tournament
            played in Germany.[11] He appeared in all four of Georgia's games, as they caused an upset by qualifying for
            the knockout phase.[12] Kakabadze recorded an assist in their final game of the tournament, a 1–4 loss to
            Spain in the round of 16.[13]</p>
