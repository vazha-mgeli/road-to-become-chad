        <p class="we">Eduardo Celmi Camavinga (born 10 November 2002) is a professional footballer who plays for La Liga
            club Real Madrid and the France national team. He is known for his tackling, versatility, and mobility. His
            usual positions are central or defensive midfielder[4] and left-back.[5][6]

            Camavinga began his career in Ligue 1 with Rennes, making his senior debut at the age of 16, and quickly
            established himself as a regular first-team player. In 2021, he signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €31
            million,
            winning a La Liga and UEFA Champions League double in his first season.

            Born in Angola, to Congolese refugees, Camavinga moved to France at a young age, eventually representing the
            country at under-21 level. He made his first senior appearance for the France national team in 2020 at the
            age
            of 17, becoming the nation's youngest debutant in over a century. He was part of the French squad that
            finished
            runners-up at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

        <p class="zx">Early life
            Camavinga was born in a refugee camp in Cabinda, Angola in 2002. His parents, Celestino Camavinga [7]
            Congolese
            born in Cabinda[8]) and Sofia Simão (also born in Cabinda[9]), had fled the civil war in DR Congo before his
            birth to a refugee camp in Miconge.[10][11][12] He has five siblings. His family moved to France when he was
            two.[13] They eventually settled in Fougères, where he grew up. He did judo for a time before giving it up
            to
            focus solely on football. In 2013, the Camavingas' house was burnt down, destroying most of the family's
            property. Camavinga stated that this was a source of motivation that pushed him to pursue a career in
            football
            and help his family.[14]

            On 7 July 2020, he obtained the Baccalauréat ES (Economic and Social) without mention.[15][16]

            Club career
            Rennes

            Camavinga in 2019
            Camavinga joined Rennes' youth system when he was 11. He signed his first professional contract on 14
            December
            2018, at the age of 16 years and one month, becoming the youngest ever professional for the club at that
            time.[17] He made his professional debut for Rennes in a 3–3 Ligue 1 tie with Angers on 6 April 2019,[18]
            becoming the youngest player to ever play for Rennes' first team,[19] at 16 years and six months old.

            On 18 August 2019, Camavinga recorded an assist and was awarded the man of the match award in a 2–1 win
            against
            Paris Saint-Germain.[20] Hence, he became the youngest player to make an assist in Ligue 1, aged 16 years
            and
            281 days.[21] He then won the UNFP Player of the Month award that month, to be the youngest player to
            achieve
            this feat.[22] He scored his first goal for Rennes in a 1–0 win against Lyon on 15 December 2019, in the
            89th
            minute of the game.[23]</p>

        <p class="fg">Real Madrid
            On 31 August 2021, Real Madrid announced the signing of Camavinga until 30 June 2027.[25] He made his debut
            in a
            5–2 win over Celta Vigo on 12 September, in which he scored a goal shortly after coming off the bench.[26]
            Three
            days later, he made his Champions League debut for Real Madrid, coming on as a substitute for Luka Modrić in
            the
            80th minute and assisting Rodrygo for the winner against Inter Milan.[27]

            Camavinga made a substitute appearance in the 85th minute of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final on 28 May,
            helping Real Madrid win 1–0 over Liverpool to earn the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League title with his
            team.[28] On
            9 May 2023, he provided an assist to Vinícius Júnior to take the lead in a 1–1 draw against Manchester City
            in
            the Champions League semi-final first leg at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, to be the youngest in the
            competition's
            semi-finals to do so, aged 20 years and 180 days.[29]

            On 7 November 2023, Real Madrid announced the extension of Camavinga's contract, which is to remain
            effective
            until 30 June 2029.[30]

            He missed the first official match of the 2024–25 season, the 2024 UEFA Super Cup, after injuring his left
            knee
            in training on the eve of the match and was expected to be out for several weeks with an internal sprain to
            the
            knee.[31][32] On 2 October 2024, Camavinga returned to action against Lille in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions
            League.[citation needed]</p>

        <p class="hj">International career
            On 31 October 2019, Camavinga obtained French nationality, benefiting from the collective effect connected
            to
            the naturalization of his father.[33][34] Until then, Camavinga had been a national of the Democratic
            Republic
            of the Congo.[35] Six days later, he was selected to represent France's under-21 team for games against
            Georgia
            and Switzerland, after Matteo Guendouzi was called up to the senior team.[36]

            On 27 August 2020, Camavinga was called up to play on France's senior team after Paul Pogba was sidelined by
            a
            positive COVID-19 test. He became, in the process, the youngest player to be called up to the French senior
            team
            since René Gérard in 1932, who was only 17 years, nine months and 17 days old.[37] On 8 September, he
            debuted in
            a 4–2 win against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League, replacing N'Golo Kanté midway through the second
            half.[38]
            In doing so he became the youngest player to play for the France national team, following Maurice Gastiger
            in
            1914 at 17 years, nine months, and 29 days old.[39]

            On 7 October 2020, Camavinga made his first start for France in a 7–1 win against Ukraine where he scored
            his
            first international goal, opening the scoring with an overhead kick. This made him the youngest goalscorer
            for
            France since Maurice Gastiger in 1914.[40]

            On 25 June 2021, Camavinga was named in Sylvain Ripoll's 18-man France squad for the Summer Olympics in
            2021.[41] However he was later removed from the squad after his club, Rennes, objected.[42]

            Camavinga played twice at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in which reigning champions France finished as runners-up
            in
            Qatar. He played as a left-back in the final group game, a 1–0 loss to Tunisia in which manager Didier
            Deschamps
            rested his regular players ahead of the knockout stage.[43] In the final, he came on after 71 minutes in
            place
            of Théo Hernandez as the French were losing 2–0 to Argentina; the game ended 2–2 after 90 minutes and 3–3
            after
            extra time, as France lost on penalties.[44]</p>
