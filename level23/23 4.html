    <h1 class="sx">Betman</h1>
    <p class="bati">Batman[b] is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was
        created by the artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
        Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
        philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. His origin story features him swearing vengeance
        against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, as a child, a vendetta tempered
        by the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and
        monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting
        characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordon; love interest
        Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.</p>

    <p class="we">Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of Superman; although Kane
        frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero
        into something more bat-like. They drew inspiration from pulp fiction characters like the Shadow and Sherlock
        Holmes. Batman received a spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Kane and Finger introduced Batman as a ruthless
        vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but he evolved into a just, tempered superhero with a
        stringent moral code that prohibits killing during the 1940s. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess
        any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television
        series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with Batman for years after it ended. Various
        creators worked to return Batman to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986
        miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.</p>

    <p class="ty">DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as
        Vertigo and Black Label; he has been considered DC's flagship character since the 1990s. The longest-running
        Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently
        depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as
        the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters used the Batman persona, such
        as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993â€“1994 "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009
        to 2011; and Jace Fox, the son of Wayne's ally Lucius, since 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring
        alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the
        incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations in comics published under the
        Elseworlds label.</p>

    <p class="az">

        Batman is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture and has been listed among the greatest comic book
        superheroes and characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his
        likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes
        toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games such as the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in many
        live-action and animated television series and films. Adam West portrayed him in the 1960s Batman television
        series, and he has been portrayed in film by Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, Ben
        Affleck, and Robert Pattinson. Many actors, most prolifically Kevin Conroy, have provided Batman's voice in
        animation and video games. In September 2024, Batman was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, being the
        first superhero to receive the honor.</p>

    <p class="rty">Creation and early history
        In early 1939, following the success of Superman, DC Comics' editors requested more superheroes.[5] Bob Kane
        created Batman, initially drawing a character with red tights, bat wings, and a domino mask. Bill Finger, a
        collaborator, made significant contributions by suggesting a cowl, cape, gloves, and a darker costume.[6] The
        character's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, was inspired by historical figures Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony
        Wayne.[7] Batman's early adventures drew inspiration from contemporary pulp fiction and characters like Zorro
        and the Shadow, establishing Batman as a master detective with a dark, brooding persona driven by the murder of
        his parents.[8][9]</p>

    <p class="es">Batman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Early stories were dark, featuring a Batman who did
        not shy away from killing. The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940. Robin,
        Batman's sidekick, was introduced in 1940, lightening the tone and boosting sales. Over the next few years,
        Batman's rogues' gallery expanded with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman. The 1950s saw Batman in
        lighter, science fiction-influenced stories. However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius
        Schwartz, who returned Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance. The 1966 Batman TV series
        introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics until its cancellation in 1968. In the
        1970s, writers Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams restored Batman's dark, gritty nature, a trend that continued
        despite fluctuating sales.</p>

    <p class="qa">Modern Age and reboots
        In the Modern Age of Comic Books Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing
        storytelling trends and audience interests. Beginning with seminal works like The Dark Knight Returns in the
        1980s,[10] which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character's narrative evolved to
        explore deeper themes and darker tones.[11] This period also saw the exploration of Batman's origins and psyche
        through works like Batman: Year One,[11][12] and Batman: The Killing Joke, which delved into the complexities of
        heroism and villainy.[13] In the 1990s, storylines such as "Knightfall" introduced new adversaries like Bane,
        who physically and mentally challenged Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley. The
        aftermath of an earthquake in "No Man's Land" depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new
        limits of heroism and survival.[14] Entering the 21st century, Grant Morrison's influential run introduced
        Damian Wayne as Batman's son and heir, bringing familial dynamics and a new generation of challenges to the
        forefront. Morrison's storytelling also delved into surreal and existential themes, such as in Batman R.I.P. and
        Final Crisis, which tested Batman's resolve and sanity against cosmic threats and personal demons.[15][16] The
        New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman's continuity while preserving core elements of his character. This era
        introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like Night of the Owls, where Batman confronts the
        Court of Owls, a clandestine society controlling Gotham for centuries. The chilling return of the Joker in
        "Death of the Family" explored the intricate relationships within Batman's extended family of allies and
        adversaries. More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman's
        universe, exploring new characters like Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the
        context of Gotham City's ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism.[17]</p>
