            <h1 class="zx"> THOR </h1>
            <P class="qw"> Thor (from Old Norse: Þórr) is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he
                is a
                hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the
                protection of humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old
                English
                as
                Thunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all
                ultimately
                stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.

                Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the
                Roman
                occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high
                popularity
                during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems
                of
                his
                hammer, Mjölnir, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to
                his
                popularity.</P>

            <p class="sa">Narratives featuring Thor are most prominently attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears
                throughout
                Norse mythology. In stories recorded in medieval Iceland, Thor bears at least fifteen names, is the
                husband
                of
                the golden-haired goddess Sif and the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa. With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess
                (and
                possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he
                fathered Móði, and he is the stepfather of the god Ullr. Thor is the son of Odin and Jörð,[1] by way of
                his
                father Odin, he has numerous brothers, including Baldr. Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides
                in a
                cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (whom he eats and resurrects), and is
                ascribed
                three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the hammer Mjölnir, wears the belt
                Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's exploits, including his
                relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr—and their
                foretold
                mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.

                Into the modern period, Thor continued to be acknowledged in folklore throughout Germanic-speaking
                Europe.
                Thor
                is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week Thursday bears his name (modern English
                Thursday
                derives from Old English thunresdaeġ, 'Thunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period
                containing
                his
                own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and
                references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is
                revived
                in the modern period in Heathenry.</p>

            <p class="rg">Name
                The name Thor is derived from Norse mythology. Its medieval Germanic equivalents or cognates are Donar
                (Old
                High
                German), Þunor (Old English), Thuner (Old Frisian), Thunar (Old Saxon), and Þórr (Old Norse),[2] the
                latter
                of
                which inspired the form Thor. Though Old Norse Þórr has only one syllable, it too comes from an earlier,
                Proto-Norse two-syllable form which can be reconstructed as *Þunarr and/or *Þunurr (evidenced by the
                poems
                Hymiskviða and Þórsdrápa, and modern Elfdalian tųosdag 'Thursday'), through the common Old Norse
                development
                of
                the sequence -unr- to -ór-.[3]

                All these forms of Thor's name descend from Proto-Germanic, but there is debate as to precisely what
                form
                the
                name took at that early stage. The form *Þunraz has been suggested[by whom?] and has the attraction of
                clearly
                containing the sequence -unr-, needed to explain the later form Þórr.[3]: 708  The form *Þunuraz is
                suggested by
                Elfdalian tųosdag ('Thursday') and by a runic inscription from around 700 from Hallbjäns in Sundre,
                Gotland,
                which includes the sequence "þunurþurus".[3]: 709–11  Finally, *Þunaraz[4] is attractive because it is
                identical
                to the name of the ancient Celtic god Taranus (by metathesis–switch of sounds–of an earlier *Tonaros,
                attested
                in the dative tanaro and the Gaulish river name Tanarus), and further related to the Latin epithet
                Tonans
                (attached to Jupiter), via the common Proto-Indo-European root for 'thunder' *(s)tenh₂-.[5] According to
                scholar
                Peter Jackson, those theonyms may have emerged as the result of the fossilization of an original epithet
                (or
                epiclesis, i.e. invocational name) of the Proto-Indo-European thunder-god *Perkwunos, since the Vedic
                weather-god Parjanya is also called stanayitnú- ('Thunderer').[6] The potentially perfect match between
                the
                thunder-gods *Tonaros and *Þunaraz, which both go back to a common form *ton(a)ros ~ *tṇros, is notable
                in
                the
                context of early Celtic–Germanic linguistic contacts, especially when added to other inherited terms
                with
                thunder attributes, such as *Meldunjaz–*meldo- (from *meldh- 'lightning, hammer', i.e. *Perkwunos'
                weapon)
                and
                *Fergunja–*Fercunyā (from *perkwun-iyā 'wooded mountains', i.e. *Perkwunos' realm).[7]</p>

            <p class="sd">The English weekday name Thursday comes from Old English Þunresdæg, meaning 'day of Þunor',
                with
                influence from Old Norse Þórsdagr. The name is cognate with Old High German Donarestag. All of these
                terms
                derive from a Late Proto-Germanic weekday name along the lines of *Þunaresdagaz ('Day of *Þun(a)raz'), a
                calque
                of Latin Iovis dies ('Day of Jove'; cf. modern Italian giovedì, French jeudi, Spanish jueves). By
                employing
                a
                practice known as interpretatio germanica during the Roman period, ancient Germanic peoples adopted the
                Latin
                weekly calendar and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own.[8][9]

                Beginning in the Viking Age, personal names containing the theonym Þórr are recorded with great
                frequency,
                whereas no examples are known prior to this period. Þórr-based names may have flourished during the
                Viking
                Age
                as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the widespread Viking Age practice of
                wearing
                Thor's hammer pendants.[10]

                Historical attestations
                Roman era

                Altar stone for Hercules Magusanus from Bonn, dated 226 AD.[11]
                The earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is
                frequently
                referred to – via a process known as interpretatio romana (where characteristics perceived to be similar
                by
                Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) – as either the Roman god Jupiter
                (also
                known as Jove) or the Greco-Roman god Hercules.

                The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus's late first-century work
                Germania,
                where,
                writing about the religion of the Suebi (a confederation of Germanic peoples), he comments that "among
                the
                gods
                Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on
                fixed
                days,
                human as well as other sacrificial victims.</p>

            <p class="qs">Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind" and adds that a
                portion
                of
                the Suebi also venerate "Isis".[12] In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god Odin as "Mercury", Thor
                as
                "Hercules", and the god Týr as "Mars", and the identity of the Isis of the Suebi has been debated. In
                Thor's
                case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between
                Thor's
                hammer and Hercules' club.[13] In his Annals, Tacitus again refers to the veneration of "Hercules" by
                the
                Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river Weser (in what is now northwestern Germany) as
                dedicated to
                him.[14] A deity known as Hercules Magusanus was venerated in Germania Inferior; due to the Roman
                identification
                of Thor with Hercules, Rudolf Simek has suggested that Magusanus was originally an epithet attached to
                the
                Proto-Germanic deity *Þunraz.[15]

                Boniface bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in Bonifacius (1905) by Emil Doepler
                The first recorded instance of the name of the god appears upon the Nordendorf fibulae, a piece of
                jewelry
                created during the Migration Period and found in Bavaria. The item bears an Elder Futhark inscribed with
                the
                name Þonar (i.e. Donar), the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.[16]

                Around the second half of the 8th century, Old English texts mention Thunor (Þunor), which likely refers
                to
                a
                Saxon version of the god. In relation, Thunor is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss Jupiter,
                the
                god
                may be referenced in the poem Solomon and Saturn, where the thunder strikes the devil with a "fiery
                axe",
                and
                the Old English expression þunorrād ("thunder ride") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led
                chariot.[17][18]

                A 9th-century AD codex from Mainz, Germany, known as the Old Saxon Baptismal Vow, records the name of
                three
                Old
                Saxon gods, UUôden (Old Saxon "Wodan")[clarification needed], Saxnôte, and Thunaer, by way of their
                renunciation
                as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally converting to Christianity.[19]</p>

            <p class="yu">According to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary Saint Boniface felled an
                oak
                tree
                dedicated to "Jove" in the 8th century, the Donar's Oak in the region of Hesse, Germany.[20]

                The Kentish royal legend, probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of
                Kent
                called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe (Old
                English
                'Thunor's mound'). Gabriel Turville-Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating
                loss of
                memory that Thunor had been a god's name.[21]

                right, Frigg, Thor and Odin
                Viking age
                In the 11th century, chronicler Adam of Bremen records in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum
                that
                a
                statue of Thor, who Adam describes as "mightiest", sits in the Temple at Uppsala in the center of a
                triple
                throne (flanked by Woden and "Fricco") located in Gamla Uppsala, Sweden. Adam details that "Thor, they
                reckon,
                rules the sky; he governs thunder and lightning, winds and storms, fine weather and fertility" and that
                "Thor,
                with his mace, looks like Jupiter". Adam details that the people of Uppsala had appointed priests to
                each of
                the
                gods, and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices. In Thor's case, he continues, these sacrifices
                were
                done
                when plague or famine threatened.[22] Earlier in the same work, Adam relays that in 1030 an English
                preacher,
                Wulfred, was lynched by assembled Germanic pagans for "profaning" a representation of Thor.[23]</p>

            <p class="sc">Two objects with runic inscriptions invoking Thor date from the 11th century, one from England
                and
                one
                from Sweden. The first, the Canterbury Charm from Canterbury, England, calls upon Thor to heal a wound
                by
                banishing a thurs.[24] The second, the Kvinneby amulet, invokes protection by both Thor and his
                hammer.[25]

                On four (or possibly five) runestones, an invocation to Thor appears that reads "May Thor hallow (these
                runes/this monument)!" The invocation appears thrice in Denmark (DR 110, DR 209, and DR 220), and a
                single
                time
                in Västergötland (VG 150), Sweden. A fifth appearance may possibly occur on a runestone found in
                Södermanland,
                Sweden (Sö 140), but the reading is contested.[26]

                Pictorial representations of Thor's hammer appear on a total of five runestones found in Denmark (DR 26
                and
                DR
                120) and in the Swedish counties of Västergötland (VG 113) and Södermanland (Sö 86 and Sö 111).[26] It
                is
                also
                seen on runestone DR 48.[citation needed] The design is believed to be a heathen response to Christian
                runestones, which often have a cross at the centre. One of the stones, Sö 86, shows a face or mask above
                the
                hammer. Anders Hultgård has argued that this is the face of Thor.[27] At least three stones depict Thor
                fishing
                for the serpent Jörmungandr: the Hørdum stone in Thy, Denmark, the Altuna Runestone in Altuna, Sweden
                and
                the
                Gosforth Cross in Gosforth, England. Sune Lindqvist argued in the 1930s that the image stone Ardre VIII
                on
                Gotland depicts two scenes from the story: Thor ripping the head of Hymir's ox and Thor and Hymir in the
                boat,[28] but this has been disputed.[29]</p>


            <p class="za">Post-Viking age
                In the 12th century, more than a century after Norway was "officially" Christianized, Thor was still
                being
                invoked by the population, as evidenced by a stick bearing a runic message found among the Bryggen
                inscriptions
                in Bergen, Norway. On the stick, both Thor and Odin are called upon for help; Thor is asked to "receive"
                the
                reader, and Odin to "own" them.[30]

                Poetic Edda
                In the Poetic Edda, compiled during the 13th century from traditional source material reaching into the
                pagan
                period, Thor appears (or is mentioned) in the poems Völuspá, Grímnismál, Skírnismál, Hárbarðsljóð,
                Hymiskviða,
                Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Alvíssmál, and Hyndluljóð.[31]


                The foretold death of Thor as depicted by Lorenz Frølich (1895)

                Thor and the Midgard Serpent (by Emil Doepler, 1905)
                In the poem Völuspá, a dead völva recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the
                disguised
                god Odin, including the death of Thor. Thor, she foretells, will do battle with the great serpent during
                the
                immense mythic war waged at Ragnarök, and there he will slay the monstrous snake, yet after he will only
                be
                able
                to take nine steps before succumbing to the venom of the beast:

                Benjamin Thorpe translation:
                Then comes the mighty son of Hlôdyn:
                (Odin's son goes with the monster to fight);
                Midgârd's Veor in his rage will slay the worm.
                Nine feet will go Fiörgyn's son,
                bowed by the serpent, who feared no foe.
                All men will their homes forsake.[32]

                Henry Adams Bellows translation:
                Hither there comes the son of Hlothyn,
                The bright snake gapes to heaven above;
                ...
                Against the serpent goes Othin's son.
                In anger smites the warder of earth,—
                Forth from their homes must all men flee;—
                Nine paces fares the son of Fjorgyn,
                And, slain by the serpent, fearless he sinks.[33]

                Afterwards, says the völva, the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world, the stars will
                disappear,
                flames will dance before the sky, steam will rise, the world will be covered in water and then it will
                be
                raised
                again, green and fertile.[34]</p>
