    <h1 class="ER">GIORGI MAMARDASHVILI</h1>
    <p class="rt">Giorgi Mamardashvili (Order of Honor) (Georgian: გიორგი მამარდაშვილი; born 29 September 2000) is a Georgian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for La Liga club Valencia and the Georgia national team. He will join Premier League club Liverpool on 1 July 2025.

        Mamardashvili spent much of his youth years at Dinamo Tbilisi. After signing a professional contract with this club, he was loaned to other Erovnuli Liga teams for three seasons before his transfer to Valencia. He has quickly established himself as a first-choice shot-stopper, becoming the first ever Georgian goalkeeper in the Spanish top tier.
