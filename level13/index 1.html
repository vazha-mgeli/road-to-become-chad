   <p>Nicholas Williams Arthuer (born 12 July 2002) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a winger for La Liga club Athletic Bilbao and the Spain national team. He is the younger brother of footballer Iñaki Williams.

    Joining Athletic Bilbao's youth academy in 2013, he was promoted to the reserve team in 2020 and to the first team a year later, becoming a teammate of elder brother Iñaki Williams. Quickly being widely recognised for his speed and dribbling skills,[2] Williams debuted for Spain's senior side in 2022. He was a member of their 2022 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2024 squads, scoring and being named man of the match in the final of the latter as Spain won the tournament.
    
    Club career
    Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Williams joined the youth academy of Athletic Bilbao in 2013 from hometown side CA Osasuna.[3] He began his senior career with the club's farm team, Basconia, during the 2019–20 season.[4]
    
    On 11 May 2020, Williams was promoted to the reserve team in the Segunda División B.[5] He made his first-team—and La Liga—debut on 28 April the following year, coming on as a second-half substitute for Jon Morcillo in a 2–2 home draw against Real Valladolid;[6] his brother Iñaki also came off the bench ten minutes later. It was the first time two siblings had been on the pitch at the same time for the club since Julio and Patxi Salinas in 1986.[7][8]</p>
