    <h1>demon slayer</h1>
    <p>Kyojuro was a young adult of tall stature and lean-muscular build. He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils. He was known to be charismatic and had an air of great optimism, having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face nearly all the time.

        Kyojuro wore the standard black Demon Slayer uniform, tinted brown in the anime, which consisted of a brown button-up jacket with stand collar and long sleeves, a white belt around his waist and tattsuke-hakama pants. Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end that his father Shinjuro had once worn and more than likely his father had worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively. Finally, he wore red kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white z≈çri with red straps.</p>
