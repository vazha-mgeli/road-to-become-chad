    <h1>antony dos santos</h1>
    <p>Antony Matheus dos Santos (born 24 February 2000), known mononymously as Antony (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈɐ̃tɔni]),[3] is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a right winger for Premier League club Manchester United and the Brazil national team.

        Antony graduated from the São Paulo academy and made his senior debut for the club in 2018. He moved abroad to Ajax in the summer of 2020, where he won two Eredivisie titles and one KNVB Cup during his two seasons. Antony's performances in the Netherlands led to a transfer worth €95 million (£82 million) to Manchester United, the highest sum paid for an Eredivisie player.
        
        Antony won a gold medal with the Brazil under-23 team at the 2020 Summer Olympics. He then made his senior international debut and scored against Venezuela in October 2021, going on to represent Brazil at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
        
        Early life
        Antony was born in Osasco, São Paulo, and grew up in Inferninho, a favela far from the city centre. Growing up, he would play football wherever he could on the streets or in his house, combining his love of futsal with street football and regularly attending São Paulo matches with his aunt.[4] He is of Portuguese descent.[5]

        Youth
        He began playing football at an early age, and he was soon spotted by São Paulo, who offered him a contract in 2010, aged 10, where he was inducted into their youth academy.[6] During his youth years, Antony struggled for game time and was close to being dismissed from the club's youth ranks, but the staff convinced his manager to keep him. While in the youth academy, Antony met Helinho and Igor Gomes, becoming good friends in the process. In September 2018, Antony helped his team win the J-League Challenge tournament in Japan, being named the tournament's best player.[7]</p>
