   <h1>lamine yamal</h1> 
   <p>Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana (born 13 July 2007) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right winger for La Liga club Barcelona and the Spain national team. Known for his pace, dribbling, passing, crossing ability, and ability to strike powerful long-range shots, he is widely regarded as one of the best young footballers in the world.[6]

    Early life
    Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana was born on 13 July 2007 in Esplugues de Llobregat, in the Barcelona metropolitan area in Catalonia,[7] to waitress Sheila Ebana and building painter Mounir Nasraoui.[8] Yamal's mother was born in Bata, Equatorial Guinea, and his father is from Larache, Morocco.[9]
    
    His parents separated when Yamal was three, although both remained present through his childhood.[10] The family had lived in Mataró, but around the time of his parents' separation, Yamal's mother moved to Granollers, where Yamal started playing football at the local club La Torreta at the age of four.[11][12] He would alternate between both cities to spend time with his parents.[10] With his father in Mataró, Yamal grew up in Rocafonda, a neighbourhood described by El País as "forgotten, isolated and stigmatized"; he celebrates goals by making a gesture of the number 304, the last digits of the local postcode 08304. Following his success, his popularisation of the number has been credited with bringing pride and recognition to the working class community of Rocafonda.[13]</p>
