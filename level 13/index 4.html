    <p>Sergio Ramos García (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈseɾxjo ˈramos ɣaɾˈθi.a];[A] born 30 March 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back. Widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, Ramos is known for his tackling skills, aerial abilities, leadership, and goalscoring, having scored more than 100 goals for Real Madrid. [3][4] He played at Real Madrid for sixteen seasons, winning multiple UEFA Champions League titles while at the club, along with two UEFA European Championships and the 2010 FIFA World Cup with the Spain national team.[5][6][7]

        Born in Seville, Ramos played in Sevilla's youth academy and spent two seasons with the senior team, before moving to Real Madrid in the summer of 2005. He went on to become a mainstay for the club, winning 22 major honours, including five La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. He was vital to all of the Champions League winning campaigns, as he was named in the competition’s Team of the Season each time. Out of contract with Real Madrid, he signed for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain in July 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice, before returning to Sevilla for one season.
        
        Internationally, Ramos represented Spain at four World Cups and three European Championships. He won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012. He was named in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2010 and in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament in 2012. He made his first appearance at the age of 18, and in 2013, he became the youngest player to reach 100 caps for Spain.[8] Ramos is currently the most capped player for Spain and is the nation’s ninth-highest top goalscorer. He also holds the record for the most matches won with Spain (131).</p>
