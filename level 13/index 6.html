    <h1>karvajal</h1>
    <p>Daniel Carvajal Ramos (Spanish pronunciation: [daˈnjel kaɾβaˈxal ˈramos]; born 11 January 1992) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right-back for La Liga club Real Madrid and the Spain national team.

        Having risen through the Real Madrid youth ranks, he spent a season with Bayer Leverkusen before returning to Real Madrid. He joined the first team in 2013 and has since won 26 major trophies at Real Madrid including four La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey titles and a joint record six Champions League wins, a record he shares with Paco Gento, Luka Modrić, Toni Kroos and Nacho.
        
        At the youth international level, Carvajal won the 2011 European Championship with the under-19 team and the 2013 edition with the under-21 team. He made his senior debut in 2014, representing the nation at the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. In 2024, he was part of the Spain squad that won the UEFA European Championship. Carvajal also scored the decisive penalty at the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals, securing Spain's first UEFA Nations League title.
        
        Club career
        Real Madrid Castilla
        Carvajal was born in Leganés, a suburb of Madrid. He joined Real Madrid's youth system as a 10-year-old, and continued climbing through the ranks until reaching Real Madrid Castilla in 2010.[4]
        
        In his first season as a senior Carvajal was immediately cast in the reserve team's starting XI, also being the team's captain. In the following campaign, he fared even better (38 games and two goals, playoffs included), as the B's returned to Segunda División after a five-year absence.[5]
        
        Bayer Leverkusen
        On 11 July 2012, after failing to make a single appearance for Real's first team,[6] Carvajal signed a five-year contract with Germany's Bayer Leverkusen for a transfer fee of €5 million. The Spaniards added on a buy-back clause in the region of €6.5 million if they wanted to re-sign the player after one season, €7 million after two and approximately €8.5 million after three.[7]
        
        Carvajal made his Bundesliga debut on 1 September 2012 in a 2–0 home win against SC Freiburg,[8] being subsequently named to the Team of the Week.[9] He scored his first goal for his new club on 25 November, netting the second in an eventual 2–1 success at TSG Hoffenheim.[10]
        
        Carvajal was selected as one of the three best right backs at the end of his first and only season, behind Bayern Munich's Phillip Lahm and Schalke 04's Atsuto Uchida. He received 16% of the total vote from the fans.[11]
        
        Real Madrid
        On 3 June 2013, Real Madrid exercised their buy-back option on Carvajal, who became the team's first signing for 2013–14 for a fee believed to be in the region of €6.5 million. This was confirmed by Bayer's director of football Rudi Völler, who stated: "Real Madrid noticed the outstanding performances by Dani this season, and it was only a matter of time before they exercised their buy-back option."[12] Shortly after the move, he spoke of his happiness to return, thanking the president, the fans and the club at a press conference.[13]
        
        Carvajal made his La Liga debut on 18 August 2013, in a 2–1 home win against Real Betis.[14] One month later he played his first match in the UEFA Champions League, again featuring the full 90 minutes in a 6–1 away victory of Galatasaray in the group stage.[15]</p>
