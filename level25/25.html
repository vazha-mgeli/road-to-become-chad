        <h1 class="q"> Federico valverde</h1>
        <p class="a">Federico Santiago Valverde Dipetta (Spanish pronunciation: [feðeˈɾiko βalˈβeɾðe];[note 1] born 22
            July 1998) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder or right-winger for La Liga club
            Real Madrid and the Uruguay national team. Regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world, he is known
            for his pace, work rate, stamina and shooting ability.[4][5][6] Mainly a central-midfielder, he is also able
            to play as a defensive-midfielder,and occasionally a right-back.[7][8]

            Valverde began his professional career with Peñarol in 2015, winning the Uruguayan Primera División in his
            first season. In 2016, he joined Real Madrid, initially playing for the club's reserve team. He made his
            first-team debut in 2017 and has since gone on to make over 250 appearances for the club, winning three La
            Liga titles, two FIFA Club World Cups, two UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Super Cups, and the Copa
            del Rey.

            Valverde made his international debut for Uruguay in 2017, and has since represented his country at three
            Copa América tournaments (2019, 2021, 2024) and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

        <p class="z">Early life
            Valverde was born on 22 July 1998 in Unión, a neighbourhood in the capital city of Montevideo, to Julio
            Valverde and Doris Dipetta. He has one older brother, Diego, and two step-brothers, Pablo and Matías
            Castro.[9][10][11] Valverde is of Spanish and Italian descent and became a naturalised Spanish citizen in
            2020 after receiving his Spanish passport.[12] Valverde started his youth career with his local
            neighbourhood club, Estudiantes de la Unión. He then tried out for Peñarol a few years later and was scouted
            by Néstor Gonçalves.[13]</p>

        <p class="x">Club career
            Peñarol
            Valverde spent most of his youth career with Peñarol, where he quickly made an impression. He made his club
            debut on 23 July, one day after his 17th birthday, in an international friendly against Cruzeiro where they
            won 3–1. He had then his senior debut for the club on 16 August 2015 in their first fixture of the 2015–16
            season against Cerro, during which he was guided and mentored by his childhood idol and teammate, Diego
            Forlán.[13][14]

            He became part of the Uruguayan national youth teams and attracted the interest of European clubs, including
            Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea and Real Madrid.[15][16][17]</p>


        <p class="s">Real Madrid
            In July 2016, Valverde was transferred from Peñarol to Real Madrid, initially being assigned to their
            reserve team Castilla.[18] Two months later, he made his debut for Castilla against Real Unión, in a game
            which his team eventually lost.[19] He became a regular member of the Castilla line-up his debut season, and
            scored his first goal against Albacete in December 2016.[20]

            In regards to his growing importance to the team, Santiago Solari, his coach at Castilla, said on 29 January
            2017, "I'm very happy with him. He has adapted very well to the club and country. Valverde always generates
            a lot of football in midfield."[21]

            Loan to Deportivo La Coruña
            On 22 June 2017, Valverde was loaned to La Liga side Deportivo de La Coruña for one year.[22] He made his
            debut in the competition on 10 September, replacing Fede Cartabia in a 2–4 home loss against Real Sociedad.
            Valverde contributed with 24 league appearances during the campaign, as the side suffered relegation.</p>

        <p class="w">2018: Return to Real Madrid

            Valverde with Real Madrid in 2018
            Upon returning from loan, Valverde impressed new manager Julen Lopetegui during the 2018–19 pre-season and
            was definitively assigned to the first-team.[23] On 23 October 2018, Valverde made his official Real Madrid
            debut in the UEFA Champions League Group stage against Viktoria Plzeň at the Bernabéu at just 20 years
            old.[24][25] He made 25 appearances and won the FIFA Club World Cup in his first season with the first
            team.[26]

            2019–2021: First team breakthrough
            With the return of Zinedine Zidane to the dugout and the departure of Marcos Llorente, Valverde broke
            through to become a key player of the squad during the 2019–20 season.[27] On 9 November 2019, he scored his
            first goal for Real Madrid, in a 4–0 away win over Eibar in La Liga.[28]</p>

        <p class="e">On 12 January 2020, Valverde tackled Álvaro Morata during the Supercopa de España Final against
            Atlético Madrid, committing a professional foul and stopping play with Morata clean through on goal.[29]
            Valverde was sent off, but his actions stopped what was a likely goal, forced a penalty shootout which Real
            Madrid won, and earned him the Man of The Match award and widespread praise. Atlético Madrid manager Diego
            Simeone later referred to the tackle as "the most important play of the game".[30] He made 33 appearances
            during the league season, as Real Madrid won the 2019–20 La Liga.[31]

            On 27 September, Valverde scored Real Madrid's first goal of the 2020–21 season away to Betis in La Liga in
            an eventual 3–2 win and was selected as the 'King of The Match'.[32] This was also his 50th La Liga match
            for Los Blancos.[33] One month later on 24 October, Valverde scored against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in
            just five minutes in an eventual 3–1 league win. He became just the second Uruguayan to score in El Clásico
            (after Luis Suárez) and the first for Real Madrid.[34] One week later, Valverde scored again, against
            Huesca, in a 4–1 league win at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium. This was his third goal of the season,
            meaning he had already scored more than in the entirety of the previous campaign.[35]</p>


        <p class="d">021–present: Contract extensions and Champions League victories

            On 24 August 2021, Valverde extended his contract until 2027.[36] On 12 January 2022, he scored Real
            Madrid's third goal in a 3–2 win over Barcelona in extra time of the Supercopa de España semi-final, a
            tournament which Madrid eventually went on to win.[37] On 28 May, he assisted Vinícius Júnior to score the
            winning goal in a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final to clinch a record 14th
            UEFA Champions League title for Real Madrid.[38]

            On 14 September 2022, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 2–0 victory over RB Leipzig.[39] In the
            2022–23 season, he netted 12 goals in all competitions, fulfilling his coach Carlo Ancelotti's pre-season
            prediction that he would score more than 10 goals.[40] On 9 November 2023, Valverde extended his contract
            with Real Madrid until 30 June 2029.[41][42]

            On 9 April 2024, he scored a first-time volley in a 3–3 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League
            quarter-finals, which eventually earned him the honour of Goal of the Season.[43] Following the victory in
            the Champions League final, it was announced that he acquire the number 8 shirt after Toni Kroos'
            retirement.[44]</p>


        <p class="c">nternational career

            Youth
            Valverde was awarded the Silver Ball at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup as Uruguay finished fourth in the
            tournament.[45]

            In 2017, Valverde was caught up in a controversial gesture after making a "slant eyes" celebration after
            scoring in the Under-20 World Cup. Valverde denied that the celebration was racist but stated that it was in
            homage to his first agent, Edgardo "El Chino" Lasalvia. FIFA called on Uruguay to explain Valverde's
            actions, as well as a celebratory photo of the squad in which several Celeste players made the same
            gestures.[46][47]

            Senior
            Valverde was called up to the Uruguay senior squad in August 2017.[48] The same year on 5 September, he
            marked his debut with his first goal against Paraguay.[49] Valverde was named in Uruguay's provisional
            26-man pool for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but left out of the final 23-man squad.[50]

            Valverde was included by manager Óscar Tabárez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 in Brazil.[51]
            In the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, a goalless draw after regulation time had the match go to a
            penalty shoot-out, Uruguay lost 4–5 and was eliminated from the competition.[52] He was also included in the
            final 23-man squad for the 2021 Copa América[53] and 2022 FIFA World Cup.[54]

            Personal life
            Valverde's previous nickname was Pajarito (baby bird), but now refers to himself as Halcón (falcon),
            alluding to his growth as a professional footballer. "Everyone joined the Halcón thing, and I liked it, it
            was very funny to me. There were people who got angry because they wanted to keep calling me Pajarito, but
            I'm the Halcón now," said Valverde in an interview.[55]

            Valverde is in a relationship with Argentinian journalist and presenter Mina Bonino. They have two sons,
            Benicio, born in 2020, and Bautista, born in 2023.[56][57]

            Valverde allegedly punched Villarreal player Álex Baena in the Santiago Bernabéu car park following a 3–2
            defeat in La Liga match on 8 April 2023. The alleged incident was alleged to have been caused by a comment
            Baena made to Valverde about Bonino's miscarriage scare. On 3 July, the case against Valverde was dismissed
            as a magistrates' court found no evidence of criminality.[58][59][60]</p>
