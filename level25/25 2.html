        <h1 class="fg">rodrigo</h1>
        <p class="gu">Rodrygo Silva de Goes (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁoˈdɾiɡu ˈsiwvɐ dʒi ˈɡɔjs];[4] born 9 January 2001),
            better known as Rodrygo, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a right winger or forward for
            La Liga club Real Madrid and the Brazil national team.

            Rodrygo began his career with Santos, where he played 80 games and scored 17 goals before a €45 million
            transfer to Real Madrid in 2019. At international level, he made his senior debut for Brazil in 2019, aged
            only 18.

            Rodrygo Goes made his senior debut for the Brazilian national team on Nov 7, 2019. Rodrygo represented his
            national team at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals. Rodrygo was passed the
            iconic number 10 shirt in the Brazil national team.[5]</p>

        <p class="gy">Born in Osasco, São Paulo, Rodrygo joined Santos' youth setup in 2011 at the age of ten, initially
            assigned to the futsal team.[2] Rodrygo traveled the world with Santos, spreading his beloved game of futsal
            under legendary futsal coach Barata who also trained Neymar, including a much heralded YouTube video with
            City Futsal in Dallas area in Texas, USA. In March 2017, with the first team regulars in Peru for a Copa
            Libertadores match against Sporting Cristal, he was called up to the first team by manager Dorival Júnior to
            complete training.[6]

            On 21 July 2017, Rodrygo signed his first professional contract, after agreeing to a five-year deal.[7] On 1
            November, he was promoted to the main squad by interim manager Elano.[8]

            Rodrygo made his first team – and Série A – debut on 4 November 2017, coming on as a late substitute for
            Bruno Henrique in a 3–1 home win against Atlético Mineiro.[9] The following 25 January he scored his first
            senior goal, netting a last-minute winner in a 2–1 Campeonato Paulista away win against Ponte Preta.[10]

            Rodrygo made his Copa Libertadores debut on 1 March 2018, replacing Eduardo Sasha in a 2–0 away loss against
            Real Garcilaso; aged 17 years and 50 days, he became the youngest player of Santos to appear in the
            competition.[11] Fifteen days later he scored his first goal in the tournament, netting his team's second
            through an individual effort in a 3–1 win against Nacional at the Pacaembu Stadium; at the age of 17 years,
            two months and six days, he became the youngest Brazilian to score in the competition[12] before his record
            was broken by fellow Santos youth graduates Kaiky and Ângelo.[13]</p>

        <p class="dr">Rodrygo scored his first goal in the main category of Brazilian football on 14 April 2018, netting
            the last in a 2–0 home win against Ceará.[14] On 3 June, he scored a hat-trick and also assisted Gabriel's
            last goal in a 5–2 home routing of Vitória.[15]

            On 26 July 2018, Rodrygo changed his jersey number from 43 to 9 (a number he already wore during the
            Libertadores).[16] For the 2019 campaign, he again switched numbers, now to jersey 11, previously worn by
            fellow youth graduate Neymar.[17]

            Real Madrid

            Rodrygo with Real Madrid in 2019
            On 15 June 2018, Real Madrid reached an agreement with Santos for the transfer of Rodrygo, with the player
            joining Los Blancos in June 2019 and signing until 2025.[18][</p>

        <p class="a">The rumoured fee was of €45 million,[20] with Santos receiving €40 million as the club owned 80% of
            his rights with the rest owned by Rodrygo's agents.[21]

            On 25 September 2019, Rodrygo made his first team debut and scored his first league goal against Osasuna
            within a mere minute.[22] He scored his first hat-trick, and gave an assist for the club on 6 November, aged
            18 years and 301 days old, against Galatasaray in a 6–0 win in the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League season.[23]
            The second youngest ever to score a hat-trick in the competition, he is also the first player born in the
            21st century to score in the tournament.[24] In his first season, he managed to make 19 appearances, while
            scoring two goals during the league season, as Real Madrid won the 2019–20 La Liga.[25] On 3 November 2020,
            Rodrygo scored the winning goal in a 3–2 victory over Inter Milan in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League.[26]

        <p class="kl">On 12 April 2022, after coming on as a substitute in the second leg of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions
            League quarter-final tie against Chelsea, he scored with a volleyed finish to send the game into extra-time,
            in which Karim Benzema scored the winner from a header, allowing Real Madrid to progress into the
            semi-finals.[27] On 30 April, Rodrygo helped Real clinch their 35th La Liga title after scoring twice in a
            4–0 win against Espanyol at the Bernabéu.[28] On 4 May, while trailing 0–1 (3–5 on aggregate) in the second
            leg of the Champions League semi-final tie against Manchester City, he scored two goals between the 90th and
            91st minutes to level the tie and send the game into extra-time. Benzema scored a penalty to win the game
            3–1, allowing Real Madrid to progress into the final against Liverpool with an aggregate score of 6–5 and
            eventually win the tournament.[29][30] Following the turnaround win against City and other recent
            last-minute winning contributions, Rodrygo’s impact on the team was praised despite his young age and he
            quickly turned into a cult hero at Madrid.[31]</p>
        <p class="r">On 18 April 2023, he scored a brace in a 2–0 away victory over Chelsea in the 2022–23 UEFA
            Champions League quarter-final second leg, which secured his team's qualification to the semi-finals by
            winning 4–0 on aggregate.[32] On 6 May, he scored two goals for Real Madrid in a 2–1 win over Osasuna in the
            2023 Copa del Rey final, to be their 20th title in that competition.[33]

            On 2 November 2023, Real Madrid announced that Rodrygo's contract had been extended, with a new expiration
            date of 30 June 2028.[34][35]</p>

        <p class="b">International career
            On 30 March 2017, Rodrygo was called up to Brazil under-17s for the year's Montaigu Tournament.[36] He made
            his debut in the championship by scoring his side's only goal in a 2–1 loss against Denmark, and netted two
            more against Cameroon and United States.[37]

            On 7 March 2018, Rodrygo and Santos teammate Yuri Alberto were called up to the under-20s,[38] but both were
            cut from the squad six days later after a request from his club's president.[39]

            In November 2019, Rodrygo was called up for the first time to the Brazil senior team, for the Superclásico
            de las Américas against rivals Argentina in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.[40] In the 1–0 loss on 15 November, he
            replaced Willian for the final 20 minutes.[41]

            On 7 November 2022, Rodrygo was named in the squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[42]</p>

        <p class="v">Style of play
            Considered to be a talented and highly promising young player in the media, and one of the best players in
            the world, Rodrygo's playing style has been likened to that of compatriot and Real Madrid team-mate Vinícius
            Júnior, due to their pace, technical skill, and similar direct style in attack. Although he does not possess
            significant physical strength or athleticism, due to his diminutive stature, Rodrygo's low centre of
            gravity, combined with his dribbling skills and resulting agility, allow him to change direction quickly
            when in possession of the ball, and beat opponents in one on one situations. He has also been noted for his
            decision-making, offensive positioning, finishing, link-up play, and creativity, which allows him to hold-up
            the ball and create space or chances for his teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself. He has also
            been praised by pundits for his work-rate and willingness to press opponents. While he normally plays as a
            right-winger, he is a versatile player, who has been used in several other positions, including on the left,
            and was also used in a free role as a right-sided forward or striker in a 4–3–1–2 formation during the
            2023–24 season by manager Carlo Ancelotti; in this position, although he operated in more central areas at
            times, he was still given the freedom to move out wide to overload the flanks, or switch positions and
            link-up with Vinícius on the other side of the pitch. Although he is naturally right-footed, Rodrygo does
            not normally play as an inverted winger on the opposite flank, in contrast to many other wingers of his
            era.[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]</p>
