        <p class="sad">Jude Victor William Bellingham (born 29 June 2003) is an English professional footballer who
            plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the England national team. Known for his pace,
            dribbling, passing, and finishing, he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.[7]

            Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8, became the club's youngest first-team player when he made
            his senior debut in August 2019, at the age of 16 years, 38 days, and played regularly during the 2019–20
            season. He joined Borussia Dortmund in July 2020, and in his first appearance became their youngest
            goalscorer. Over three seasons with the club he made 132 appearances and won the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal; his
            performances in the 2022–23 season helped Dortmund finish as runners-up and earned him the Bundesliga Player
            of the Season award. Later that year he won both major awards for male footballers aged under 21: the Golden
            Boy, for nominees playing in Europe over the last calendar year,[8] and the Kopa Trophy, for the world's
            best over the previous season.[9][10] Bellingham then signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €103 million, and
            in his first season, was the club's top league scorer, helped them win the league title and the Champions
            League, and was voted La Liga Player of the Season.[11]</p>

        <p class="zx">Bellingham represented England at under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-21 levels. He made his
            first appearance for the senior team in November 2020, and represented the country at UEFA Euro 2020 and
            2024 as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

            Early life and education
            Jude Victor William Bellingham[12] was born on 29 June 2003[2] in Stourbridge, in the Metropolitan Borough
            of Dudley, West Midlands,[13] the eldest son of Denise and Mark Bellingham.[14][15] His father Mark was,
            until 2022, a sergeant in the West Midlands Police, and a prolific goalscorer in non-League
            football.[16][15][17] Bellingham's younger brother, Jobe, is also a footballer.[18] Bellingham was privately
            educated at Priory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham.[19][20] He grew up idolising Zinedine Zidane.[21]
            Bellingham graduated from Loughborough College with a BTEC level 3 certificate in sport in 2021.[22]</p>


        <p class="qsa">Club career
            Birmingham City
            Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8,[13] after playing for Stourbridge Juniors.[23] He played
            for their under-18 team at 14,[18] and made his debut for their under-23 team at the age of 15, on 15
            October 2018 away to Nottingham Forest's U23s. Entering the game after an hour, he scored the only goal in
            the 87th minute "sliding in to force the ball over the goal line after pressure by Kyle McFarlane on the
            keeper diverted the ball into his path."[24] By March 2019, he had three goals from ten development squad
            appearances,[25] had featured in FourFourTwo's list of the "50 most exciting teenagers in English
            football",[26] and was mentioned as of interest to major European clubs.[25][27] He was gradually introduced
            to the first-team environment while still a schoolboy: increasingly training with the seniors, he
            accompanied them on matchday to observe,[18] and travelled as the "19th man" for a Championship match in
            March.[25</p>


        <p class="er">Bellingham took up a two-year scholarship with Birmingham City to begin in July 2019.[28] He was
            part of the first-team training camp in Portugal,[29] played and scored in pre-season friendlies,[30] and
            was given squad number 22 for the 2019–20 season.[31] On 6 August, when he started the EFL Cup first round
            visit to Portsmouth, Bellingham became the youngest first-team player in Birmingham City's history. At 16
            years, 38 days, he lowered the record set by Trevor Francis in 1970 by 101 days.[13] He played for 80
            minutes in the 3–0 defeat, and was the Birmingham Mail's man of the match.[32] He made his first Football
            League appearance 19 days later, as a second-half substitute in a 3–0 defeat away to Swansea City,[33] and
            his home debut on 31 August against Stoke City. Replacing the injured Jefferson Montero after half an hour,
            Bellingham scored the winner – albeit via a generous deflection – as Birmingham came back from 1–0 down to
            beat Stoke 2–1, and thus became their youngest goalscorer, aged 16 years, 63 days.[34] He started the next
            match, away to Charlton Athletic two weeks later, and scored the only goal from Kerim Mrabti's cutback.[35]

        </p>

        <p class="rt">Bellingham continued as a permanent fixture in the matchday squad, sometimes as a substitute but
            mainly in the starting eleven.[20] He was eased into the team on the left wing, moved into central midfield
            "where he could gain more confidence", and then used "in a more advanced role" once the staff were sure he
            could cope with the responsibility.[20] He was EFL Young Player of the Month for November 2019.[15]
            According to head coach Pep Clotet, Bellingham himself "feels more comfortable in midfield, and more
            comfortable when he can get closer to the opposition box."[36]</p>

        <p class="zc">Bellingham was linked with moves to numerous major clubs in January 2020;[37] on deadline day,
            Birmingham were reported to have turned down a £20 million bid from Manchester United.[38] Bellingham
            continued as a first-team regular, and by the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19
            pandemic, he had made 32 league appearances. He remained an integral part of the team once the season
            resumed behind closed doors,[33] and set up a late equaliser for Lukas Jutkiewicz against Charlton Athletic
            that made Birmingham's league position less precarious with two matches still to play.[39] He finished the
            season with four goals from 44 appearances in all competitions, 41 in the league, as Birmingham avoided
            relegation despite losing the last match of the season.[33][40] In appreciation of what Bellingham achieved
            in such a short time with the first team, the club announced that they would retire his number 22 shirt, "to
            remember one of our own and to inspire others."[41] At the EFL Awards, he was named both Championship
            Apprentice of the Year and EFL Young Player of the Season.[42]</p>

        <p class="jk">Borussia Dortmund
            It was clear that Bellingham would leave Birmingham, and it was reported that he and his father had visited
            several major clubs, of which Manchester United and Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund were the
            favourites.[43] Impressed by Dortmund's record of including young players as regulars in the first team, as
            evidenced by the likes of Jadon Sancho, Bellingham reportedly settled on the club as his destination of
            choice. He flew to Germany for a medical, and the transfer was confirmed on 20 July 2020. Bellingham was to
            join after Birmingham's last match of the season.[43] The undisclosed fee was understood by Sky Sports to be
            an initial £25 million – making him the most expensive 17-year-old in history – plus "several million more"
            dependent on performance-related criteria.[43]</p>

        <p class="wer">2020–2021: Transfer and record-breaking achievements
            Bellingham made his debut on 14 September 2020, starting the first match of the 2020–21 season against
            third-tier MSV Duisburg in the DFB-Pokal, aged 17 years, 77 days. After half an hour, he scored the second
            goal in a 5–0 win, becoming the club's youngest goalscorer in the DFB-Pokal, taking six days off Giovanni
            Reyna's record, as well as their youngest scorer in any competitive match, breaking Nuri Şahin's record by
            five days.[44] Five days later, he marked his league debut with the assist for Reyna's opening goal in a 3–0
            win over Borussia Mönchengladbach,[45] and was named as Bundesliga Rookie of the Month for September.[46]
            When Bellingham faced Lazio in the group stage on 20 October, aged 17 years and 113 days, he became the
            youngest Englishman to start a UEFA Champions League match, breaking the record previously set by Phil
            Foden.[47]


            Bellingham playing for Borussia Dortmund in 2020
            In the first three months of the season, Bellingham was a regular in all competitions, with six starts and
            seven substitute appearances in the Bundesliga as well as four Champions League starts.[2] He missed the
            first two matches of 2021 with a foot injury,[48] but returned to action as an increasingly regular
            starter.[2] He scored his first Bundesliga goal from Reyna's knock-down to equalise with VfB Stuttgart early
            in the second half of a 3–2 win on 10 April.[49] His first Champions League goal came four days later
            against Manchester City in the quarter-final second leg, but Dortmund could not retain their away-goal
            advantage.[50] Bellingham started in Dortmund's 4–1 victory over RB Leipzig in the 2021 DFB-Pokal final. He
            was booked in the first half and replaced by Thorgan Hazard at half-time with his team 3–0 ahead.[51] He
            finished the season with 29 appearances and one goal in the Bundesliga, 46 appearances and four goals in all
            competitions,[2] and was voted Newcomer of the Season by his fellow players.[52] Bellingham was runner-up to
            Pedri of Barcelona in the 2021 Kopa Trophy, awarded to the world's best under-21 male player as voted by
            previous winners of the Ballon d'Or.[53][10]</p>

        <p class="f">2021–2023: Bundesliga Player of the Season and league runner-up
            On 4 December 2021, Bellingham played in Der Klassiker against Bayern Munich. He made the assists for both
            Dortmund goals,[54] but Bayern won the match 3–2 via a 77th-minute penalty awarded after lengthy VAR
            involvement. Earlier in the fixture, two Dortmund penalty appeals were turned down by referee Felix Zwayer,
            who refused to review either.[55][56] Interviewed live by Viaplay immediately after the match, Bellingham
            was critical of Zwayer's decisions, and made reference to his part in the 2005 German football match-fixing
            scandal, saying: "You give a referee, that has match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany. What do you
            expect?"[57] The German Football Association (DFB) wrote to Bellingham asking for his comments as a matter
            of urgency,[57] and he was fined €40,000.[58]</p>

        <p class="rty">On 22 October 2022, Bellingham scored twice in a 5–0 defeat of Stuttgart that put Borussia
            Dortmund into the top four; his first opened the scoring from a rapid attack that he both started and
            finished, his second was a skilfully curved shot early in the second half.[59] On the final day of the
            Bundesliga season, Dortmund needed to beat Mainz 05 to ensure the league title. Bellingham was on the bench
            because of an injured knee, and remained unused. Dortmund managed to draw after falling 2–0 behind, but
            Bayern Munich's 89th-minute winner against 1. FC Köln was enough to put them ahead on goal difference. After
            the match, a tearful Bellingham pushed cameras away as he left the field.[60][61] His performances earned
            him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award.[62] Having finished as runner-up two years prior, Bellingham
            won the Kopa Trophy in 2023 in recognition of his performances over the 2022–23 season for Dortmund and for
            England in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He became the first Englishman to receive the award, which was presented
            at the 2023 Ballon d'Or ceremony in October.[9] He placed 18th in the Ballon d'Or voting.</p>


        <p class="fgn">Real Madrid
            On 14 June 2023, Real Madrid announced the signing of Bellingham on a six-year contract.[63] Borussia
            Dortmund would receive a base transfer fee of €103 million with potential to rise by 30% to approximately
            €133.9 million due to add-ons,[64] from which a sell-on clause would earn Birmingham City around £6
            million.[65] He became the sixth Englishman to join Real Madrid in the professional era.[66][A]

            2023–24: Debut season and goalscoring records
            On 12 August 2023, Bellingham marked his debut with a close-range half-volleyed goal from a corner kick in a
            2–0 La Liga win away to Athletic Bilbao.[67] Two goals and an assist for Vinícius Júnior in a 3–1 victory at
            Almería[68] and the winner at Celta Vigo in the two remaining August matches made him the league's top
            scorer and the first English recipient of the La Liga Player of the Month award.[69] A 95th-minute winner
            against Getafe on 2 September in his first match at the newly renovated Santiago Bernabéu made Bellingham
            the third player (after Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2009–10 season and Pepillo in 1959–60) to score in each of
            his first four competitive appearances for the club.[70] Bellingham scored 10 goals in his first 10 matches
            for Madrid, equalling Cristiano Ronaldo's goal tally after his first 10 games for the club in 2009.[71] On
            28 October, Bellingham scored a brace, including a stoppage-time winner, to secure Real Madrid a 2–1 away
            win against their rivals Barcelona, making him the first Real Madrid player to score in their La Liga and
            Champions League debuts for the club and in El Clásico.[72] His first goal, scored from 30 yards (27 m)[73]
            was his club's 300th in El Clásico and made him the first Englishman to score in that fixture since Michael
            Owen in 2005.[74] Bellingham set several records with these goals.[B] His coach Carlo Ancelotti commented:
            "He seems like a veteran, the goal to level it totally changed the game... Today he was stupendous and
            shocked everyone with his wonderful goal from the edge of the area."[73] Bellingham was named La Liga Player
            of the Month for October.[79]

            Having received the Kopa Trophy a few weeks earlier,[9] Bellingham was named winner of the Golden Boy for
            2023, an award made to the best male under-21 footballer playing in the European top divisions over a
            calendar year.[8] Bellingham dislocated his left shoulder on 5 November, and returned to action against
            Cádiz three weeks later only because of an injury crisis at the club. Wearing heavy strapping, he assisted
            the first goal and scored the third of a 3–0 win, which took Madrid top of the table and his personal total
            to 14 from his first 15 games, breaking the club record held jointly by Pruden, Alfredo Di Stéfano and
            Cristiano Ronaldo.[80][81] In a 4–2 victory against Napoli on 29 November, Bellingham became the first
            player to score in each of his first four Champions League appearances for Real Madrid.[82]</p>
